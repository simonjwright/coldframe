<dt>Warning: <i>Class</i>: no rule to hash <i>Type</i> <dd>ColdFrame doesn't know how to hash values of type <tt>Type</tt> in order to make a reasonable hash function. This normally happens when <tt>Type</tt> is <tt>{imported}</tt>. The generated code will still operate, but it's best if you can replace the default <tt>Class.Instance_Hash</tt>. <br>If the imported type is discrete (for example, an integer or an enumeration), you can say <a href="types.html#hash"><tt>{hash=discrete}</tt> or <tt>{hash=enumeration}</tt></a>.

<dt>Warning: upper or lower bound not specified for <i>Type</i> <dd>Provide both upper and lower bounds for {integer} or {real} types.
