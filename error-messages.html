<h3>"Normalization" messages</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Error: abbreviation of <i>name</i> is reserved word <dd>For class <i>name</i>, the standard abbreviation (for names of more than one word, formed from the initial letters of the words) makes an Ada reserved word. Specify your own, using the <tt>[[abbreviation]]</tt> annotation.

<dt>Error: attribute <i>Class.Attribute</i> used to formalize non-existent <i>Association</i> <dd>The <tt>formalizes</tt> annotation has been used naming an association that doesn't exist.

<dt>Error: attribute <i>Class.Name</i> marked as &#171class;&#187; and &#171;id&#187; <dd>Class attributes can't be identifying attributes as well.

<dt>Error: both ends of <i>name</i> are marked as source <dd>The <tt>[[source]]</tt> annotation has been specified on both ends of the named association.

<dt>Error: <i>Class</i> tried to set <i>Role</i> as source for <i>Association</i> <dd>Probably, you've used <tt>[[source]]</tt> in a disallowed way (on the <i>many</i> end of an association).

<dt>Error: <i>Class</i> tried to set <i>Role</i> as source for <i>Association</i> when <i>Role</i> already is. <dd>Probably, you've used <tt>[[source]]</tt> on both ends of the named association.

<dt>Error: discriminated type <i>type</i> has no attributes <dd>Discriminated types must have attributes.

<dt>Error: illegal lower bound 1 in cardinality "<i>cardinality</i>" for <i>name</i> <dd>In class <i>name</i>, <tt>1..1</tt> is legal for a class's cardinality, otherwise it must be <tt>1</tt>, <tt>n</tt> or <tt>0..<i>m</i></tt>.

<dt>Error: illegal lower bound (<i>b</i>) of multiplicity in role <i>Association.Role</i> <dd>The lower bound of a role multiplicity must be 0 or 1.

<dt>Error: illegal lower bound <i>bound</i> in cardinality "<i>cardinality</i>" for <i>name</i> <dd>In class <i>name</i>, <tt>1..1</tt> is legal for a class's cardinality, otherwise it must be <tt>1</tt>, the literal <tt>n</tt> or <tt>0..<i>m</i></tt>.

<dt>Error: illegal M:M association <i>Association</i> <dd>Many-to-many associations must have an association class.

<dt>Error: illegal name "<i>name</i>" in [$cls -getName].[$op -getName] <dd>There's some illegal character in an operation's parameter (you may have used a semicolon rather than a comma to separate parameters).

<dt>Error: illegal name "<i>name</i>" in &lt;<i>tag</i>&gt; <dd>There's some illegal character in a &lt;tag&gt; element (eg, a &lt;class&gt;.

<dt>Error: missing attribute name in <i>Class</i> <dd>One of the attributes of the named class has no name.

<dt>Error: missing attribute type for <i>Class.Attribute</i> <dd>The named attribute has no type specified.

<dt>Error: missing parameter name in <i>Class.Operation</i> <dd>There's a problem with one of the named operation's parameters.

<dt>Error: missing parameter type for <i>Class.Operation(Param)</i> <dd>There's a problem with the named operation parameter.

<dt>Error: multiple parents <i>Class</i>, <i>Class</i> in <i>Inheritance</i> <dd>More than one class is the parent in the named inheritance relationship.

<dt>Error: must specify cardinality for <i>name</i> as 0..<i>bound</i> <dd>In class <i>name</i>, <tt>1..1</tt> is legal for a class's cardinality, otherwise it must be <tt>1</tt>, the literal <tt>n</tt> or <tt>0..<i>m</i></tt>.

<dt>Error: <i>name</i> has no identifier <dd>Ordinary classes must have identifiers.

<dt>Error: neither end of biconditional <i>name</i> is marked as source <dd>Symmetric 0..1:0..1 associations must have the source end marked. Place <tt>[[source]]</tt> on the end you want it to be most efficient to navigate <i>to</i>.

<dt>Error: neither end of unconditional <i>name</i> is marked as source <dd>Symmetric 1:1 associations must have the source end marked. Place <tt>[[source]]</tt> on the end you want it to be most efficient to navigate <i>to</i>.

<dt>Error: reserved word "<i>word</i>" in &lt;<i>tag</i>&gt; <dd>You've used an Ada reserved word as a name.

<dt>Error: singleton <i>name</i> has identifier <dd>Singleton's aren't allowed to have identifiers.

<dt>Error: tried to extend <i>type</i>, which has no attributes <dd>If a type is to be extended, it must have attributes.

<dt>Error: type <i>name</i> has identifier <dd><i>name</i> is a &#171;type&#187;; it can't have an identifier.

<dt>Error: unrecognised multiplicity "<i>string</i>" in role <i>Association.Role</i> <dd>Multiplicities should be 1, 0..1, 1..*, 0..*, * or n.

<dt>Error: unrecognised parameter mode <i>mode</i> <dd>A parameter mode must be <tt>in</tt>, <tt>inout</tt> or <tt>out</tt>.

</dl>



<dl>

<dt>Warning: annotation not handled, "<i>Entity [[annotation :
value]]</i>" <dd>The given annotation wasn't understood.

<dt>Warning: can't open <i>file</i>: <i>reason</i> <dd>Unable to open case exception file.

<dt>Warning: stereotype not handled, "<i>Entity &#171;stereotype&#187;</i>" <dd>The given stereotype wasn't understood.

<h3>Code generation messages</h3>


<dl>

<dt>Error: <i>Class</i>.Delete not allowed as a singleton entry action. <dd>It's not permitted to delete a singleton.

<dt>Error: <i>Class.Operation</i> has too many parameters to be an entry action. <dd>An entry action in the model can have at most one parameter (the event payload). Of course, for non-singleton classes there will be an initial <tt>This</tt> parameter in the generated code.

<dt>Error: <i>Class.Operation</i> is a function, can't be an entry action. <dd>Only procedures are allowed to be state machine entry actions.

<dt>Error: <i>Class.Operation</i>'s parameter is of the wrong type. <dd>If an entry action has a parameter, it must be of the type of associated event's payload.

<dt>Error: invalid use of Autonumber in <i>Class</i> <dd>Probably, you've specified an identifier with other attributes besides an <tt>Autonumber</tt> one (<tt>Autonumber</tt> attributes are expected to be the only ones).

<dt>Error: no concrete operation for <i>Parent.Operation</i> in <i>Leaf</i> <dd><tt>Operation</tt> was specified &#171;abstract&#187; in <tt>Parent</tt>, but no implementation has been found in the branch leading to the leaf class <tt>Leaf</tt>.

<dt>Warning: <i>Class</i>: no rule to hash <i>Type</i> <dd>ColdFrame doesn't know how to hash values of type <tt>Type</tt> in order to make a reasonable hash function. This normally happens when <tt>Type</tt> is <tt>[[imported]]</tt>. The generated code will still operate, but it's best if you can replace the default <tt>Class.Hash</tt>.
