<h1>ColdFrame: Associations</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<h3>Associations and role names</h3>

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the object
of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name, the
subject is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might have
<em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>.

<p>Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing.

<h3>Associations and multiplicity</h3>

<p>You need to think carefully about the multiplicity of associations;
they capture application rules and policies, which it's important to
get right.

<p>Clearly each <em>Screen</em> <em>"displays"</em> a number
of <em>Window</em>s, but can a <em>Window</em> <em>"appear on"</em>
more than one <em>Screen</em>? (perhaps, if you have multi-headed
display capability). Can you have a <em>Window</em> which <em>"appears
on"</em> no <em>Screen</em>s? (well, no, not if your display
technology is X--in which case <em>"appears on"</em> may not be quite
right either, since the application could be iconised).

<p>Unconditional multiplicity is good; if each end of an association
is conditional (0..1, 0..n), maybe you should think more carefully
about it. Perhaps there's some super/subtype (<a
href="generalizations.html">inheritance</a>) relationship lurking in
there.

<h3>Formalising associations</h3>

<p>In the original Shlaer-Mellor method, associations and inheritance
relationships needed to be "formalised" by the use of "referential
attributes". Considering the <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>,
where clearly there are many <em>Window</em>s but only one
<em>Screen</em>, you'd need a referential attribute
<em>screen&nbsp;id</em> in the <em>Window</em> instance.

<p>ColdFrame, however, follows <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML</a>; you
usually don't need to provide referential attributes (it would be
quite cumbersome to do so, since Rose (taking it as a typical UML
tool) is unaware of the concept). Instead, ColdFrame automatically
implements the relationships. Sometimes it needs a little help, for
example for <a href="#formalizes">complex formalization</a> or <a
href="#source">in a symmetric association</a>.
