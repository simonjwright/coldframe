<h1>ColdFrame: Associations</h1>

<!--
<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<h3>Associations and role names</h3>

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the object
of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name, the
subject is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might have
<em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>.

<p><img src="window-screen.jpg">

<p>Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing.

<h3>Associations and multiplicity</h3>

<p>You need to think carefully about the multiplicity of associations;
they capture application rules and policies, which it's important to
get right.

<p>Clearly each <em>Screen</em> <em>"displays"</em> a number
of <em>Window</em>s, but can a <em>Window</em> <em>"appear on"</em>
more than one <em>Screen</em>? (perhaps, if you have multi-headed
display capability). Can you have a <em>Window</em> which <em>"appears
on"</em> no <em>Screen</em>s? (well, no, not if your display
technology is X--in which case <em>"appears on"</em> may not be quite
right either, since the application could be iconised).

<p>Unconditional multiplicity is good; if each end of an association
is conditional (0..1, 0..n), maybe you should think more carefully
about it. Perhaps there's some super/subtype (<a
href="generalizations.html">inheritance</a>) relationship lurking in
there.

<h3>Formalising associations</h3>

<p>In the original Shlaer-Mellor method, associations and inheritance
relationships needed to be "formalised" by the use of "referential
attributes". Considering <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, where
clearly there are many <em>Window</em>s but only one <em>Screen</em>,
you'd need a referential attribute <em>screen&nbsp;id</em> in the
<em>Window</em> instance.

<p>ColdFrame, however, follows <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML</a>; you
usually don't need to provide referential attributes (it would be
quite cumbersome to do so, since Rose, as is typical for a UML tool,
is unaware of the concept). Instead, ColdFrame automatically
implements the relationships. Sometimes it needs a little help, for
example for complex formalization or in a symmetric association.

<h4>Complex formalization</h4>

<p>Consider R8, <em>Licence</em> <em>"is issued by"</em> <em>Licensing
Office</em>. The identifier of Licence consists of the licence number
and also the issuing Licensing Office, since the various offices don't
use disjoint licence number ranges. In this case, we'd specify the
attribute as
<pre>
   &#171;id&#187; issuing office : Licensing Office
</pre>

<p>and include the tagged value

<pre>
   { formalizes = r8 }
</pre>

<h4><a name="symmetric">Symmetric associations</a></h4>

<p>If you have a symmetrical association of multiplicity <i>1:1</i>,
<i>1c:1c</i>, <i>1-(1:1)</i> or <i>1-(1c:1c)</i>, ColdFrame requires
you to tell it how the association is to be formalized.

<p>You do this by including the tag
<pre>
   { source }
</pre>

<p>in the documentation of one of the roles.

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>Each Association maps into

<ul>

<li>a package
<tt><i>Domain.Association</i></tt>, which deals with linking,
unlinking and navigation from single instances

<li>a package
<tt><i>Domain.Association</i>.From_Collections</tt>, which deals with
navigation from collections of instances

<li>a "referential attribute" (or two, in the case of a many-to-many
association, with its associative class).

</ul>

<h3>Linking</h3>

<p>All association packages include a <tt>Link</tt> operation. In the
case of the Library example <a href="#simple-association">below</a>,
this would be
<pre>
   procedure Link
     (Is_On_Loan_To : Borrower.Handle;
      Is_Borrowing : Book.Handle);
</pre>

<p>whereas if the association had had an association class <i>Current
Loan</i> (not a bad idea; where else would you put the date when the
book is due for return?) the <tt>Link</tt> operation would be a
function:
<pre>
   function Link
     (Is_On_Loan_To : Borrower.Handle;
      Is_Borrowing : Book.Handle)
     return Current_Loan.Handle;
</pre>

<h3>Unlinking</h3>

<p>All association packages include an <tt>Unlink</tt> operation. In
the case of the Library example <a
href="#simple-association">below</a>, this would be
<pre>
   procedure Unlink
     (Is_On_Loan_To : Borrower.Handle;
      Is_Borrowing : Book.Handle);
</pre>

<p>whereas if the association had had an association class <i>Current
Loan</i> the <tt>Unlink</tt> operation would be
<pre>
   procedure Unlink
     (Current_Loan_Handle : Current_Loan.Handle);
</pre>

<p>Note that in this case <tt>Unlink</tt> doesn't actually delete the
association instance; this is because you may have cleaning-up jobs to
do (unlinking other associations with the association instance, for
example).

<h3>Finding</h3>

<p>For associations with an associative class, a <tt>Find</tt>
operation is generated in <tt><i>Domain.Association</i></tt> which,
given the handles of two potentially associated instances, returns the
corresponding associative instance's handle (or <tt>null</tt>, of
course).

<h3>Referential attributes</h3>

<p>The implementing referential attrubute, and its assciated "get",
"set" operations are in the public part of the class package but
aren't intended for general use; use the
<tt><i>Domain.Association</i></tt> package's operations instead.

<p>In the present implementation (18.x.02), each navigation has a
<i>natural</i> and a <i>hard</i> direction. The natural direction is
from the class in which the referential attribute is
implemented.

<p>Normally you have no choice on where the referential attributes go;
for example, in a <i>1:m</i> association, ColdFrame puts the
referential attribute at the <i>many</i> end. However, in <a
href="#symmetric">symmetric associations</a>, you should put the
required <tt>{&nbsp;source&nbsp;}</tt> tag on the end that you want to
be able to get to more efficiently.

<h2><a name="use">Use</a></h2>

<p>It can be difficult to work out which of the navigation operations
you need to use.

<p><a name="simple-association"><img src="simple-association.png"></a>

<p>In the diagram, <tt><i>Domain</i>.A2</tt> has two navigation
operations:

<ul>

<li><tt>Is_Borrowing</tt> takes a <i>Book</i> (<tt>Book.Handle</tt>)
parameter and returns a <i>Borrower</i> (<tt>Borrower.Handle</tt>),
which may be <tt>null</tt>.

<li><tt>Is_On_Loan_To</tt> takes a <i>Borrower</i> and returns a
collection of <i>Books</i> (<tt>Book.Collections.Collection</tt>).

</ul>

<p>This is as though <i>is&nbsp;borrowing()</i> were an operation of
<i>Book</i> and <i>is&nbsp;on&nbsp;loan&nbsp;to()</i> were an
operation of <i>Borrower</i>.

<p>It may help to ask yourself, as you write the assignment
<pre>
   Borrower_H := A2.<i>what goes here</i> (Book_H);
</pre>

<blockquote>
"what is the <i>result</i> that <i>role</i> this <i>starting
instance</i>?"
</blockquote>

<p>which in this case is "what is the <i>Borrower</i> that <i>is
borrowing</i> this <i>Book</i>?"

<p><img src="reflexive.png">

<p>It's more difficult with reflexive associations, and if you get it
wrong the compiler won't be able to help you. The litte mnemonic above
needs adjustment;

<blockquote>
"what is the <b>other</b> <i>Strategy</i> that
<i>role</i> this <i>Strategy</i>"
</blockquote>

<p>and the answer is probably "<i>is fallback for</i>".
