<p>Archives are available in <tt>.zip</tt> or <tt>.tgz</tt>
(<tt>.tar.gz</tt>) form. The file name encodes the date of the
release: <tt>cf-20010130.zip</tt> is the zipped release of 30 January
2001.

<dd>Operations can be stereotyped as "access to subprogram" (and, by
implication, as &#171;class&#187; operations) using
&#171;access&#187;. This was actually present but undocumented in
20010520.


<p>Allow types to be <tt>[[imported]]</tt>.


<p>Partitioned inheritance trees were not being distinguished
properly.


<p>Support "autonumber" attributes.


<p>Domain types are generated in (reverse) dependency order, so you
can safely specify records containing records.


<p>1-(1:1), 1-(1:1c), 1-(1c:1c) associations now supported.


<p>Operations are generated with "separate" bodies, instead of using
child subprogram units.


<p>Active classes (in Rose, go to the Class/Detail tab and select
Active) are generated with a task for each instance. The task body is
"separate".


<p>Singleton (but not Interface) classes now provide a <tt>Handle</tt>
type (accessed through the <tt>Find</tt> function), for use in
associations.


<p>All Classes have a &#171;class&#187; operation <tt>Initialize</tt>
(no parameters); the Domain has an Initialize operation which calls
each of the Class' Initialize (in alphabetical order).


<p>If the Saxon command line parameter <tt>generate-accessors</tt>
isn't set to <tt>yes</tt>, attribute accessor subprograms won't be
generated.


<p>The Makefiles set the file protection on generated code to
read-only (to give you some sort of warning when you accidentally edit
generated code).


<p>Include proper default initialization for Date/Time.


<p>Dispatching operations supported, including &#171;abstract&#187;
operations.


<p>Associations with &#171;singleton&#187;s now supported.


<p>

<dt>20010520

<dd>Includes support for Associations.


<p>Generates HTML documentation.


<p>Supports record &#171;type&#187;s (no check yet that record types
are declared after record types that they reference).


<p>Provides a callback facility (the Observer pattern).


<p>Allows the use of a class' Cardinality instead of <tt>[[max]]</tt>
or &#171;singleton&#187;.


<p>

<dt>20010325

<dd>Whether a class is a singleton or not is now determined by the
&#171;singleton&#187; stereotype (or annotation).


<p>All classes except those with the &#171;interface&#187; stereotype
or annotation are implemented as private
children. &#171;interface&#187; classes are automatically
&#171;singleton&#187;s.


<p>If a class is implemented using Bounded containers (because the
number of instances is known), a fixed-size storage pool is used for
the Handle access type (so that memory is only allocated from the
heap at package elaboration). This has forced the
<tt>Abstract_Containers</tt> package to be implemented as a child of
the <tt><i>Domain.Class</i></tt> package.


<p>References are implemented using the <tt>Handle</tt> of the
referenced class. This means we have to use the GNAT "with type"
extension.

<br>I've included a <tt>pragma Extensions_Allowed (On);</tt> in each
package that needs it, but there seems to be a GNAT problem here
(3.13p, 3.14a) so you may need to include this in your configuration
file (<tt>gnat.adc</tt>) or use the <tt>-gnatX</tt> flag.


<p>The child class enumeration literals now have <tt>_T</tt> appended
(otherwise the literals masked the class package, so you had to say
<tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.thing</tt> rather than just
<tt><i>Class</i>.thing</tt> in subprogram bodies).


<p><tt>Delete</tt> operations didn't in fact free allocated memory.


<p>You need at least Release 20010325 of the <a
href="http://www.pushface.org/components/bc/">Booch Components</a>.


<p>

<dt>20010228

<dd>Choose between Bounded and Unbounded Containers depending on the
class' <tt>[[ max: <i>max-size</i> ]]</tt> documentation annotation.

<p>Choose the number of hash buckets for Bounded Maps depending on the
<tt>[[ max: <i>max-size</i> ]]</tt> documentation annotation.

<p>Added documentation on the paraphernalia surrounding an Identified
Class Package.

<p>

<dt>20010204

<dd>Added support for singleton classes (classes with no Identifier
attributes).

<p>Added documentation of the relationship between the normalized
ColdFrame metamodel and generated Ada.

<p>

<dt>20010130

<dd>Initial release.
