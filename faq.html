<h2><a name="inheritance">What strange sort of inheritance is this?</a></h2>

<p>The thinking behind ColdFrame is that you should be making analysis
models rather than code models. <a
href="resources.html#analysis-patterns">Martin Fowler</a> discusses
this in his Appendix A.

<p>One way of looking at it is that modelling ought to be, as far as
reasonable, independent of the software architecture (both the
implementation language and the support infrastructure). What we are
modelling is generalization. We may be able to implement
generalization using inheritance in our implementation language, but
this can easily fall foul of practicalities; perhaps we have to
implement in C; maybe we're using an SQL database to implement
persistence; our implementation language may not support
<em>multiple</em> inheritance.

<p>Another aspect is dynamic versus static classification.

<p>The major use of generalization (well, specialization) is to
classify aspects of the subject matter. Inheritance, as implemented in
C++ or other object-oriented programming languages, is fine for static
classification (subtyping Animal as Pig, Goat, Cow for example).

<p>However, a very useful analysis technique is dynamic
classification. Rent-a-Wreck has a fleet of vans, which are sometimes
on hire. We might want to model this as <i>Hirer hires Van</i>, which
is biconditional (a known Hirer may not have any Van on hire at the
moment; a Van may not be hired to anyone at the moment). The model can
be made less vague by subtyping Van into Hired Van and Available Van;
now all Hired Vans have a Hirer, so the code doesn't need to check
whether there's a Hirer or not.

<p>The problem with implementing this model using programming language
inheritance arises when the Van changes from being Available to being
Hired. There's only one code object, so you have to create a new
<i>HiredVan</i>, copy the relevant attributes from the old
<i>AvailableVan</i> to it, break any associations with other objects
(for instance, the <i>ServiceHistory</i>), delete the old
<i>AvailableVan</i> and remake the associations.

<p>ColdFrame adopts a halfway-house approach to this, combining the <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML (originally
Shlaer-Mellor) view of generalization</a> with dispatching and
inherited operations.

<p>Of course, there is a cost to dynamic classification; you have to
decide whether increased precision in the model is worth the extra run
time costs of maintaining the model.

<p>

<h2><a name="composition">Why doesn't ColdFrame support composition?</a></h2>

<p>ColdFrame does support composition, in that the &#171;type&#187;
stereotype allows you to build types of arbitrary complexity and
include attributes of these types in your classes.

<p>If you have a <i>Circle</i> which is at a <i>Point</i>, create a
&#171;type&#187; <i>Point</i> (presumably with attributes <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>, themselves of some appropriate type) and give the
<i>Circle</i> an attribute <i>centre&nbsp;:&nbsp;Point</i>.

<p>The thing to remember is that (almost by definition) these things
are values not objects (that is, one <i>Point(3,&nbsp;4)</i> is
indistinguishable from another), and you don't need to navigate from
the <i>Point</i> to the <i>Circle</i>.

<p>If you feel the need to contain all Rent-a-Wreck's <i>Van</i>s in a
<i>Fleet</i> (singleton) class, so as to keep track of them all,
resist it!  ColdFrame's implementation of <i>Van</i> includes a
container which holds all the current <i>Van</i> instances, so you can
get at them at any time.

<p>

<h2><a name="aggregation">Why doesn't ColdFrame support aggregation?</a></h2>

<p>It's not at all obvious what aggregation is for; it seems to add
very little over a normal association.

<p>If your intent is to classify in some way (perhaps you have a
singleton <i>HiredVans</i> class, which aggregates all the <i>Van</i>s
which are on hire), you'll almost certainly find that an existing
association (between <i>Van</i> and <i>Hirer</i>) or specialization
(of <i>HiredVan</i> from <i>Van</i>) will do the trick.

<p>One clue here is the difficulty of providing strong role names for
an aggregate association: <i>"contains"</i>, <i>"is in"</i> are fairly
feeble.

<p>Another indicator that this is happening is the need to name a
class "List" (<i>Threat List</i>, for instance).

<p>

<h2><a name="role-names">I don't understand about role names.</a></h2>

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the object
of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name, the
subject is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might have
<em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>.

<p><img src="window-screen.jpg">

<p>Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing.

<p>There are <a href="associations.html#use">notes on usage</a>.

<h2><a name="unlink">Why do some <tt><i>Association</i>.Unlink</tt>
operations do nothing?</a></h2>

<p>Associations are implemented using pointers (handles) in one of the
class instances involved in the association. Unlinking involves
nulling out the handle variable.

<p>ColdFrame doesn't enforce model integrity (at some future time, it
may provide model validation checks), so it's left up to you to delete
any instances you may need to. For instance, if every <i>Author</i>
must "<i>have written</i>" at least one <i>Book</i> and you delete the
last <i>Book</i> by a particular <i>Author</i>, you need to delete the
<i>Author</i> too.

<p>The <tt>Unlink</tt> operations that do nothing are those where the
association concerned has an association class. In this case, the
handle variable or variables concerned are in the association
class. This has two consequences:

<ul>

<li>the variable(s) are immutable, because they're part of the
association class's Identifier

<li>deleting the association class instance, which you'd have to do to
preserve model integrity, actually does all that's necessary to
unlink.

</ul>

<p>It would have been possible for <tt>Unlink</tt> to <tt>Delete</tt>
the association class instance directly, but that would rely on your
having cleaned up any other associations between the association class
and the rest of the model beforehand (or in a &#171;finalize&#187;
operation; however, using &#171;finalize&#187; operations to maintain
model integrity is an advanced practice!)

<h2><a name="why-not-delete">.. so why can't I just call Delete?</a></h2>

<p>At the moment, ColdFrame implements the minimum necessary to
support navigation. For example, a one-to-many association is
implemented by pointers from the <i>many</i> end to the <i>one</i>
end.

<p>This means that navigating from the <i>many</i> end to the
<i>one</i> end is much quicker than navigating in the reverse
direction.

<p>At a later stage, it may become cleverer; it might add supporting
tables of references to speed up navigation in what is now the
unnatural direction (you might need to tell it to do
so). <tt>Unlink</tt> would then do what was needed to keep those
tables consistent.

<h2><a name="singleton-pause-until-init">How can I make an
&#171;active&#187; &#171;singleton&#187;'s task wait until the domain
is completely initialized?</a></h2>

<p>Use the boolean variable
(<tt><i>Domain</i>.Domain_Initialized</tt>) that ColdFrame itself uses
to ensure it only initializes a domain once:
<pre>
   while not Domain_Initialized loop
      delay 0.1;
   end loop;
</pre>

<h2><a name="deleting-instances-with-pending-events">What happens if
I delete an instance with an event pending?</a></h2>

<p>"I want to post an event to be handled at a specific time in the
future. It is however possible that my application is stopped before
that time and I have deleted the object which would handle it. I
understand from the documentation that once an event is posted, it
cannot be cancelled."
<br>"Will there be a problem when I delete the object if there is an
event outstanding? Will there be a problem when the event reaches the
head of the event queue if the object has been deleted?"

<p>When an instance is deleted, all its instance events (whether held
until some later time or just in the queue to be actioned immediately)
are invalidated, so that when their time arrives or they get to the
head of the dispatcher queue they are deleted without being actioned.

<p>If an instance has a Timer, any event <i>set</i> on that timer will
similarly be discarded when the instance is deleted.

<p>So instance deletion is a very good idiom for getting rid of
left-over events. I've recently seen a lot of models where this isn't
used&#150;for example, a Target modelled as a singleton rather than
only existing when there actually <i>is</i> a target. This means it
has to have an 'idle' state and great unnecessary complexity in its
state machine&#150;for example, left-over events occurring in the idle
state having to be marked &#171;ignore&#187;.
