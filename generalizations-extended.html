<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>There's additional support, particularly for dynamic classification
(subtype migration). It's in child packages
<tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Inheritance</tt>, one for each class involved
in inheritance relationships.

<p>There are two motivations for the use of a child package:

<ul>

<li>you don't need to add to your executable's size unless you use the
feature,

<li>it's possible to use <tt><i>Class</i>.Handle</tt> rather than
<tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt> - at any rate for "finds".

</ul>

<p><img src="hierarchies-full.png">

<p>The picture shows a fairly complex inheritance hierarchy.

<p><img src="hierarchies.png">

<p>This picture shows a subset of the hierarchy, with all the
generated operations (in
<tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Inheritance</tt>). The operation
<tt>create&nbsp;new()</tt> was included to show that an operation of a
class can invoke operations declared in child packages of the class
(specifically, <tt>Inheritance.Create_Tree</tt>).

<h2><a name="creation">Creation</a></h2>

<p>All of the classes have a <tt>Create_Tree</tt> function. This
function has as many parameters as there are "ultimate" or "root"
ancestors; so classes which are in fact roots classes themselves have
only the one parameter. The parameters' names are the abbreviations of
the ultimate ancestor classes, and the types are all
<tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt>.

<p>As you'd expect from the name, the operation creates complete
trees. The simple example is where you don't already have any
instances and just want to create the tree all the way to the root(s):
so, say you wanted a new <i>F_2</i>, you'd write

<pre>
F2_H := F_2.Inheritance.Create_Tree (null, null, null);
</pre>

<p>which results in new instances of <i>R_1</i>, <i>R_2</i>,
<i>R_3</i>, <i>S_2</i>, <i>S_3</i>, <i>T_2</i> and <i>F_2</i>, all
properly linked.

<p><em>Note, this can only work where the root classes have
<tt>Autonumber</tt> identifiers.</em> If you have a root class with a
user-supplied identifier, ie with a <tt>Create</tt> function that
takes parameters, you'll need to do the root creation for this class
yourself:

<pre>
R1_H := R_1.Create ((Name => +"Foo"));
F2_H := F_2.Inheritance.Create_Tree
  (R1 => ColdFrame.Instances.Handle (R1_H),
   R2 => null,
   R3 => null);
</pre>

<p>(if you don't, you'll get a
<tt>ColdFrame.Exceptions.No_Default_Create</tt> exception).

<p>If you already have a <i>T_2</i> (in <tt>T2_H</tt>) and want to
create a new <i>F_2</i> with a new right hand side, you'd say

<pre>
F2_H := F_2.Inheritance.Create_Tree
  (R1 => ColdFrame.Instances.Handle (T2_H),
   R2 => null,
   R3 => null);
</pre>

<p>If you already have an <i>S_3</i> (in <tt>S3_H</tt>) and want to
create a new <i>F_2</i> with a new left hand side, you'd say

<pre>
F2_H := F_2.Inheritance.Create_Tree
  (R1 => null,
   R2 => ColdFrame.Instances.Handle (S3_H),
   R3 => ColdFrame.Instances.Handle (S3_H));
</pre>

<p>So, the rule is that you supply the handle of the existing parent
on the way to each root class; and, if the existing parent has two (or
more!) root ancestors, you supply its handle for each. If you make a
mistake here, you'll get one of two exceptions from
<tt>ColdFrame.Exceptions</tt>:

<dl>

<dt><tt>Unexpected_Class</tt><dd>means that a supplied handle didn't
match any class along the indicated route.

<dt><tt>Mismatched_Instances</tt><dd>occurs if you supply different
instances of a class with more than one ultimate ancestor.

</dl>

<h2><a name="finds">Finds</a></h2>

<p>Each child class has an operation
<tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Inheritance.Find_<i>parent-class</i>_Parent</tt>
for each parental class, returning
<tt><i>parent-class</i>.Handle</tt>.

<h2><a name="deletion">Deletion</a></h2>

<p>All classes that have children (ie, not <i>F_2</i> in the diagram)
have a <tt>Delete_Child</tt> operation. This deletes the entire
subtree beneath.
