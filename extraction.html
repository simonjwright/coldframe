<h1>ColdFrame: Extraction of models from Rose</h1>

<p>The Rose model is extracted to a raw "domain definition file" (type
<tt>.raw</tt>) using a RoseScript script <tt>extractor.ebs</tt>.

<p>Install <tt>extractor.ebs</tt> in the Rose <i>Add-ins</i> menu (or
whichever other one you want to use). In
<tt>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rose\</tt> or thereabouts, edit
<tt>rose.mnu</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Menu Add-Ins
{
  Separator

  option "Generate &XML..."	
   {
	RoseScript $ColdFrame\extractor.ebs
   }

}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This means, of course, that you must set the Rose Path Map variable
<tt>ColdFrame</tt> to the directory where ColdFrame is installed (eg,
<tt>d:\cf-20010707</tt>).

<p>The Extractor extracts data for the selected Domain packages or, if
none are selected, for all the packages on the current active class
diagram (if any). A recommended approach is to have a diagram (called
<i>Code Generation</i>, perhaps) and drag all the Domain packages in
your model onto it.

<p>You can select packages to be extracted in the Code Generation
diagram.

<p>The extracted domain definition file name is the domain name with
underscores substituted for spaces.

<p>You can specify the output file location using the Rose Path Map
variable <tt>ColdFrameOut</tt>. The default output file location if
<tt>ColdFrameOut</tt> isn't specified is the directory that
<tt>extractor.ebs</tt> was loaded from (sorry about
that). Double-clicking on the <tt>.mdl</tt> file or using the "recent
documents" facility of Windows opens Rose with the correct default
directory.

<p>The output format is XML, using a Document Type Description (<a
href="ddf.dtd">DTD</a>) designed to be easy to output from RoseScript
and to handle in the next stage using a SAX-compliant parser.
