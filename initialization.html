<h1>ColdFrame: Initialization</h1>

<p>ColdFrame initializes a domain when you call the generated
operation <tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</tt>. This operation takes a
single parameter, defaulted to <tt>null</tt>, that designates
the <a href="event-use.html#eventqueues">event queue</a> to be used by
the domain.

<p>Only the first call to <tt>Initialize</tt> (after the program has
been started or, if you're testing, after the domain has
been <a href="domains.html#teardown">torn down</a>) has any effect. In
particular, this
supports <a href="domains.html#cascade-initialize">cascade
initialization</a>.

<h2>Sequence of actions</h2>

<p>The domain is initialized by

<ol>

<li>initializing the domain's Event Queue (<tt>Dispatcher</tt>) with
the supplied Event Queue, or (if it's <tt>null</tt>) by calling
<tt><i>Domain</i>.Events.Initialize</tt>,

<li>calling the domain setup operation,

<li>and then initializing all class attributes with default values and
creating all singletons.

</ol>

<p>Everything is done in alphabetical order by class.

<h2>Event queues</h2>

<p>By default, standard event queues start running as soon as they're
created, while test event queues don't. When building a large program,
it's best to use one event queue for all the domains and not to let it
start until you've finished initialization.

<p>You can create an unstarted standard event queue in your main
program (or AUnit setup) by:
<pre>
Q : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_Queue_P
  := new ColdFrame.Project.Events.Standard.Event_Queue_Base
     (Start_Started => <font color="blue">False</font>,
      Priority => System.Default_Priority,
      Storage_Size => 20_000);
</pre>

<p>(<tt>constant</tt> because you don't alter the access value; you
can set the priority if you want, though there's no obvious benefit to
doing so; and you can alter the stack size of the task context within
which all the state machine actions are executed from the default, but
it may indicate a problem with your design if you need to).

<p>After you've initialized all the domains with <tt>Q</tt>, start it
by
<pre>
ColdFrame.Project.Events.Start (Q);
</pre>

<h2>Domain setup operation</h2>

<p>ColdFrame creates a procedure
<pre>
private procedure <i>Domain</i>.Setup;
</pre>
<p>(<tt>private</tt> means it can't be called from outside the domain).

<p>A null body is generated, to be replaced if necessary by
appropriate code in the <tt>.impl</tt> directory.

<p>The intended purpose of this operation is to set up the initial
instances and associations. At the point it's called, there are no
instances of any class, including singletons, and class variables with
initial values haven't been set up.

<h2><a name="singleton">&#171;Singleton&#187; classes</a></h2>

<p>At the point where a singleton class instance is created,
no <i>&#171;init&#187;</i> operations have been called. This means
that the initial instances of other classes, and the associations
between them, don't exist yet.

<p>This will only matter if any of the singleton's code gets executed
at this point; this can happen if the singleton has a state machine or
is active. Or, of course, both, for added flavour.

<h3>Singletons with state machines</h3>

<p>If a state machine has a completion transition (one which doesn't
need an event to trigger it) from its initial state, ColdFrame
performs that transition synchronously during instance creation.

<p>This results in the entry actions in the next state being called
during creation (if there aren't any, why do you have the completion
transition?).

<p>This is always problematic, but especially so for a singleton since
the rest of the domain doesn't exist yet. The canonical solution is
not to use completion transitions from initial states; instead, use an
actual event posted by class initialization (called <i>start</i>,
perhaps).

<h3>&#171;Active&#187; singletons</h3>

<p>The task associated with an instance of an active class begins
execution during instance creation. This is always likely to lead to
difficulty, but it's especially so with singletons since the rest of
the domain isn't initialized yet.

<p>The standard solution for non-singleton tasks is to have an
initial <i>&#171;entry&#187;</i>, again called <i>start</i>
perhaps, called at an appropriate point (again, you can use an event
posted by class initialization).

<p>An alternative for singletons is to have the task loop (with a
short delay, please!) until the variable <tt>Domain_Initialized</tt>
becomes <tt>True</tt>:
<pre>
begin
   while not Domain_Initialized loop
      delay 0.01;
   end loop;
   ...
</pre>

<h2>Class initialization</h2>

<p>Classes are initialized in alphabetical order.

<p>If you have a class attribute which is an access type (maybe a
counterpart), the language will initialize it at elaboration but it
won't be automatically re-initialized
after <a href="domains.html#teardown">teardown</a> unless you give a
default value (<tt>= null</tt>) in the model.

<p><a href="event-modelling.html#class-timers">Class <i>Timer</i>s</a>
may not be reinitialized properly after teardown.

<p>After class attributes have been initialized, any operations
stereotyped <i>&#171;init&#187;</i> are called, again in alphabetical
order within the class.

<p>This ordering means that, for most purposes, you'll probably only
want to have one <i>&#171;init&#187;</i> operation in the domain.
