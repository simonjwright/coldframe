<h1>ColdFrame: Initialization</h1>

<p>ColdFrame initializes a domain when the you call the
operation <tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</tt>. This operation takes a
single parameter, defaulted to <tt>null</tt>, that designates
the <a href="event-use.html#eventqueues">event queue</a> to be used by
the domain.

<p>Only the first call to <tt>Initialize</tt> (after the program has
been started or, if you're testing, after the domain has
been <a href="domains.html#teardown">torn down</a>) has any effect. In
particular, this
supports <a href="domains.html#cascade-initialize">cascade
initialization</a>.

<h2>Sequence of actions</h2>

<p>The domain is initialized by

<ol>

<li>initializing the domain's Event Queue with the supplied Event
Queue, or (if it's <tt>null</tt>) by calling
<tt><i>Domain</i>.Events.Initialize</tt>,

<li>calling the domain initialization operation, if one was specified
by <i>{init=package.operation}</i>,

<li>initializing all class attributes with default values and creating
all singletons,

<li>and then calling all the
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em> operations of all the classes.

</ol>

<p>Everything is done in alphabetical order by class and then by
operation.

<h2>Event queues</h2>

<h2>Domain initialization operation</h2>

<p>The intended purpose of the domain initialization operation is to
set up the environment expected by later initializations. At the point
it's called, there are no instances of any class, including
singletons.

<h2>&#171;Singleton&#187; classes</h2>

<p>At the point where a singleton class instance is created,
no <em>&#171;init&#187;</em> operations have been called. This means
that the initial instances of other classes, and the associations
between them, don't exist yet.

<p>This will only matter if any of the singleton's code gets executed
at this point; this can happen if the singleton has a state machine or
is active.

<h3>Singletons with state machines</h3>

<p>If a state machine has a completion transition (one which doesn't
need an event to trigger it) from its initial state, ColdFrame
performs that transition synchronously during instance creation.

<p>This results in the entry actions in the next state being called
during creation (if there aren't any, why do you have the completion
transition?).

<p>This is always problematic, but especially so for a singleton since
the rest of the domain doesn't exist yet. The canonical solution is
not to use completion transitions from initial states; instead, use an
actual event posted by class initialization (called <i>start</i>,
perhaps).
