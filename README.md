# ColdFrame #

ColdFrame is an open-source code generator backend for use with UML
tools.

In its present state, it's targeted
at [ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/)<sup>1</sup> and
generates [Ada](http://www.adaic.org/) code frameworks.

The intermediate representation uses [XML](http://www.xml.com/).

The code generation uses the XSL Transformation
([XSLT](http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/)) language, so - with an
investment in time and thought - you can design your own
transformation mechanisms to the programming language of your choice.

See [here](https://simonjwright.github.io/coldframe/) for more
information.

There are [examples](examples/).
