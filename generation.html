<body bgcolor="white">
<h1>ColdFrame: Generation of code</h1>

<p>Code is generated using the <a href="resources.html#xslt">XSLT</a>
stylesheet <tt>generate-ada.xsl</tt>. The XSLT processor I've used is
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/">SAXON</a> XSLT
Processor from Michael Kay.

<p>The output is placed by the <tt>Makefile</tt> into one Ada source
file, <tt><i>package-name</i>.ada</tt>.

<p>If you're using <a href="http://www.gnat.com/">GNAT</a>, you'll
then need to use <tt>gnatchop</tt> to split the file into the required
"one file per library unit" style. Other compilers will have their own
way of importing the code. Note, however, that the supplied
stylesheets make use of GNAT extensions (<tt>'Object_Size</tt>,
<tt>'Unrestricted_Access</tt>).

<p>The generated code is compilable, but most of the operation bodies
will raise the exception <tt>Program_Error</tt> if called (except for
operations recognised as accessors).

<p>ColdFrame makes no attempt to allow you to modify generated bodies
and preserve your changes on the next generation; instead, the idea is
that you keep the generated code in one directory and your real code
bodies in another directory that's earlier on the compiler's source
search path. I'm not sure how the idea of placing real subprogram body
files earlier in the compiler's source search path translates to
compilers other than GNAT; however, on regeneration the supplied
Makefile deletes all generated code bodies that have implementations
(this should make use of the GNAT <i>Project</i> facility easier, when
it arrives).

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>XSLT script options are passed to the script using assignments of
the form <tt>option=<i>value</i></tt> on the Saxon command line. The
script <tt>generate-ada.xsl</tt> recognises the options

<dl>

<dt><tt>add-blank-lines</tt>

<dd>If the value is <tt>yes</tt>, blank lines are added to the
generated Ada to make it easier to read, in case you have to.

<p>

<dt><tt>coldframe-version</tt>

<dd>Specifies a string (the supplied Makefiles use
<tt>cf-<i>yyyymmdd</i></tt>) which is output by this phase in the
comments in the generated Ada to tell the release of
<tt>generate-ada.xsl</tt> that was used.

<p>

<dt><tt>continuation-indent</tt>

<dd>Specifies the indentation increment for continuation lines; the
value is a string of space characters, the default being 2 spaces.

<p>

<dt><tt>generate-accessors</tt>

<dd>If the value is <tt>yes</tt>, both <tt>Set</tt> and <tt>Get</tt>
accessor operations will be generated directly in the package body for
all attributes.

<p>If the value is <tt>defined</tt> (the Makefile default), operations
which match the profile of accessors
(<tt>Get_<i>attribute-name</i></tt> with no parameters returning a
value of <tt><i>attribute-type</i></tt>, or
<tt>Set_<i>attribute-name</i></tt> with no return value and a single
parameter of <tt><i>attribute-type</i></tt>) will have proper bodies
generated for them (they will still be generated as <tt>separate</tt>
subprograms, though).

<p>Otherwise, no special notice will be taken of accessors or
attributes.

<p>

<dt><tt>standard-indent</tt>

<dd>Specifies the standard indentation increment; the value is a
string of space characters, the default being 3 spaces.

<p>

<dt><tt>verbose</tt>

<dd>Specifies whether ColdFrame should report what it's doing.
