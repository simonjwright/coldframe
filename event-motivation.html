<h1>ColdFrame: Event motivation</h1>

In ColdFrame, events are used for two purposes:

<ul>
<li>to isolate domains
<li>to support state modelling.
</ul>

<h3>Domain isolation</h3>

<p>Many systems use the Layered approach to architecture, and it's
likely that a ColdFrame-based system will do the same. In any case,
there has to be support for interactions between different Domains
(subject matters).

<p>Domains near the system's devices will need to have tasks to help
them support the devices, probably on at least a "one task per device"
basis.

<p>When you're designing a higher-level domain, you'll probably want
to use the <tt>{callback}</tt> facility (ColdFrame's version of the
Observer pattern) to isolate yourself from the workings of the device
domains. However, if you're using more than one device, your callbacks
will be being called from more than one thread of execution, which you
must provide protection against.

<p>ColdFrame's Event support allows you to do this by converting the
callback message into an event (with a data payload) to be handled
later in the context of a thread in your domain.

<h3>State modelling</h3>

<p>State modelling is a very useful technique when objects have
lifecycles, and especially when they react differently depending on the
state they've reached. Another indicator is when times and intervals
are involved.
