<h1>ColdFrame: Event motivation</h1>

<p>In ColdFrame, events are used for two purposes:

<ul>
<li>to isolate <a href="domains.html">domains</a>
<li>to support state modelling.
</ul>

<h2>Domain isolation</h2>

<p>Many systems use the Layered approach to architecture, and it's
likely that a ColdFrame-based system will do the same. In any case,
there has to be support for interactions between different Domains
(subject matters).

<p>Classes in domains near the system's devices will <a
href="active-classes.html">need to have tasks</a> to help them support
the devices, probably on at least a "one task per device" basis.

<p>When you're designing a higher-level domain, you'll probably want
to use the <em><a href="callbacks.html">&#171;callback&#187;</a></em> facility
(ColdFrame's version of the Observer pattern) to isolate yourself from
the workings of the device domains. However, if you're using more than
one device, your callbacks will be being called from more than one
thread of execution, which you must provide protection against.

<p>ColdFrame's Event support allows you to do this by converting the
callback message into a <i>class event</i> (with a data payload) to be
handled later in the context of a thread in your domain.

<h2>State modelling</h2>

<p>State modelling is a very useful technique when objects have
lifecycles, and especially when they react differently depending on the
state they've reached. Another indicator is when times and intervals
are involved.

<p>Transitions between states happen as a result of <i>instance
events</i>.
