<h1>ColdFrame: Classes</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>A class typically is an abstraction of something in the <a
href="domains.html ">domain</a> of interest. It represents the common
properties and behaviour shared by all instances of the class.

<p>Not all classes represent concrete concepts (such as <em>Cat</em>
or <em>Book</em>). It's common for classes to represent incidents
(<em>Button Press</em>), relationships (<em>Book Borrowing</em>) or
roles (<em>Hired Van</em>).

<p>See also:
<ul>
<li><a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>
<li><a href="operations.html">operations</a>
<li><a href="active-classes.html">active classes</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="modelling">Modelling</a></h2>

<p>A class is modelled, of course, by a UML class.

<p>In ColdFrame, not all UML "class" symbols represent what we're
discussing here:

<ul>

<li>you use the stereotype <em>&#171;datatype&#187;</em>, or one of the
shorthand stereotypes
<ul>
<li><em>&#171;callback&#187;</em>,
<li><em>&#171;counterpart&#187;</em>,
<li><em>&#171;discriminated&#187;</em>,
<li><em>&#171;protected&#187;</em>
</ul>
which indicate that the class symbol in fact represents a <a
href="types.html">type</a>.

<li>you use the stereotype <em>&#171;public&#187;</em> when the class
symbol in fact represents a callable interface between the domain and
other domains (a "class utility").
<br>Note, a &#171;public&#187; class is to a large extent part of the
intended implementation rather than part of the problem domain!
However, you'll probably only find &#171;public&#187; classes in
service domains, so it's arguable that they do correspond to a part of
the problem.

</ul>

<p>Given that, classes come in three flavours: normal, singleton and
utility.

<p>Utility classes have no instances (you could think of them as
representing a library of functions).

<p>A singleton class (marked <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>) always
has precisely one instance; you don't need to create it, and you can't
delete it.

<p>Normal classes start off with no instances; the instances have to
be <a href="#create">created</a>, and may be deleted.

<p>Instances of a normal class must be uniquely identifiable by some
<a href="attributes.html">attribute</a> or combination of
attributes. The identifying attributes, like any other attributes,
ought to be of non-composite types.

<p>For example, a <i>Book Edition</i> is uniquely identified by its
<i>ISBN</i>. This is an example of a <i>naming attribute</i>: <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Leon Starr</a> says

<blockquote>
[A naming attribute exists] not so much to describe, but to identify,
instances. [...] A naming attribute may or may not be sufficient to
uniquely identify instances of a class. For example, the attribute
<i>Employee Name</i> is a naming attribute, but it is possible to have
two employees with the same name.
</blockquote>

<p>In another example, a Vehicle Excise Disk (the round paper
certificate, to be displayed on the vehicle's windscreen, that (until
October 2014) showed you'd paid the UK road tax for the year) might be
identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark (the string of
letters and digits on the numberplate) and Validity Start
Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start Date then become
"identifying attributes", whereas Date Of Issue and Period Of Validity
are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in <a href="generalizations.html">inheritance
relationships</a>,
<li>association classes,
<li>public classes,
<li>singletons,
<li>types or
<li>utility classes.
</ul>

<p>All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this,
ColdFrame doesn't follow <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML</a>; it seems
risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute <a href="types.html">type</a>
<tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like the Microsoft Access feature
it's named after): each newly-created instance gets a new value.

<h3>Use of Stereotypes</h3>

<p>Classes which represent user-defined <a href="types.html">types</a>
are marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;datatype&#187;</em>. (The
stereotypes <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em>, <em>&#171;counterpart&#187;</em>,
<em>&#171;discriminated&#187;</em> and <em>&#171;protected&#187;</em>
imply <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>).

<p>Classes of which there is always precisely one instance are marked
with the stereotype <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>Public classes, which are normally the only classes visible from
outside the Domain, are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>. They can have at most one instance (you
don't need to say <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>). Public classes
can't take part in
<a href="associations.html">associations</a>.

<p>In ColdFrame, all parents
in <a href="generalizations.html">inheritance relationships</a> are
abstract and may be marked as such using the <i>isAbstract</i>
checkbox in the <i>modifiers</i> section of the class's
ArgoUML <i>Properties</i> tab. This has no effect on code generation
at present.

<p><a href="active-classes.html">Active classes</a> (where each
instance is to be associated with a run-time thread or task) may be
marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;active&#187;</em> or, if
preferred, by setting the <i>isActive</i> checkbox in
the <i>modifiers</i> section of the class's ArgoUML <i>Properties</i>
tab (which is less immediately visible, and doesn't allow the
associated tagged values to be used).

<p>The stereotype &#171;active&#187; has associated tagged values
<dl>

<dt><tt>priority = <i>priority</i></tt>
<dd>allows you to specify the priority of each instance of
an <a href="active-classes.html">active class</a>, relative to the
system's default priority (larger numbers mean higher priority).

<dt><tt>stack = <i>stack-size</i></tt>
<dd>allows you to specify a non-default stack size for each instance
of an <a href="active-classes.html">active class</a>.

</dl>

<p><a name="class-abbreviation">By</a> default, a class's abbreviation
(used in the translation of associations and generalizations) is
composed of the initial letters of the words that make up the full
class name or, if the name is a single word, the name prefixed
with <tt>A_</tt> or <tt>An_</tt> as appropriate. This rule wouldn't
work for, for example, <i>New Threat</i> and <i>Non Threat</i>. If
this happens, or if the abbreviation turns out to be a reserved word,
use <em>&#171;abbreviation&#187;</em>, with its associated tagged
value <tt>abbreviation = <i>abbrev</i></tt>, to specify an
alternative.

<h2>Translation</h2>

<li><a href="active-classes.html">Active classes</a>
</ul>

<h3><a name="library-structure">Ada library structure</a></h3>

<p>All the classes in a <a href="domains.html">domain</a> are
translated as first-level children of the domain package:

<pre>
<i>private</i> package <i>Domain.Class</i> is
   ...
end <i>Domain.Class</i>;
</pre>

<p>(<tt>private</tt> applies to all the classes bar those marked
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>).

<p>If the class is <em>&#171;public&#187;</em> or a
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>, that's it. For normal classes, the
following additional library units are generated:

<dl>

<dt><tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.All_Instances</tt>
<dd>A function which returns a Vector containing the
<tt>Handle</tt>s of all the current instances of the class.

<pre>
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors;
function <i>Domain.Class</i>.All_Instances
  return <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors.Vector;
pragma Elaborate_Body (<i>Domain.Class</i>.All_Instances);
</pre>

<dt><tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Selection_Function</tt>
<dd>A generic function which is instantiated with a <tt>Pass</tt>
function that takes a <tt>Handle</tt> and returns <tt>True</tt> if the
instance is required. It takes no parameters and returns a Vector
containing the <tt>Handle</tt>s of all the current instances of the
class that pass the <tt>Pass</tt> function.

<pre>
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors;
generic
   with function Pass (This : Handle) return Boolean is &lt;&gt;;
function <i>Domain.Class</i>.Selection_Function
  return <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors.Vector;
pragma Elaborate_Body (<i>Domain.Class</i>.Selection_Function);
</pre>

<dt><tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Filter_Function</tt>
<dd>A generic function which is instantiated with a <tt>Pass</tt>
function that takes a <tt>Handle</tt> and returns <tt>True</tt> if the
instance is required. It takes a Vector parameter and returns
another Vector containing the <tt>Handle</tt>s of all the
instances in the input Vector that pass the <tt>Pass</tt>
function.

<pre>
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors;
generic
   with function Pass (This : Handle) return Boolean is &lt;&gt;;
function <i>Domain.Class</i>.Filter_Function
  (The_Vector : <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors.Vector)
  return <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors.Vector;
pragma Elaborate_Body (<i>Domain.Class</i>.Filter_Function);
</pre>

<dt><tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Iterate</tt>
<dd>A simple generic closed iterator over Vectors; to be
instantiated with the procedure to be called to process each
<tt>Handle</tt>.

<pre>
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors;
generic
   with procedure Process (H : Handle);
procedure <i>Domain.Class</i>.Iterate
  (Over : <i>Domain.Class</i>.Vectors.Vector);
pragma Elaborate_Body (<i>Domain.Class</i>.Iterate);
</pre>

<!--
<dt><tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Abstract_Sets</tt>
<dd>An abstract instantiation of Booch Sets of
<tt>Handle</tt>s. Contains set <tt>Difference</tt>,
<tt>Intersection</tt> and <tt>Union</tt> operations.

<pre>
with BC.Containers.Sets;
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Abstract_Containers;
package <i>Domain.Class</i>.Abstract_Sets
is new Abstract_Containers.Sets;
</pre>

<dt><tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Sets</tt>
<dd>A concrete instantiation of Booch Sets of
<tt>Handle</tt>s. If the maximum number of instances was specified,
these will be the Bounded variety; otherwise, Unbounded. The interface
is the same in either case.

<pre>
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Handle_Hash;
with BC.Containers.Sets.Bounded;
with <i>Domain.Class</i>.Abstract_Sets;
package <i>Domain.Class</i>.Sets
is new Abstract_Sets.Bounded
  (Hash => <i>Domain.Class</i>.Handle_Hash,
   Buckets => 11,
   Maximum_Size => 42);
</pre>
-->

</dl>

<h3><a name="externals">Package externals</a></h3>

<p>A class's identifying attribute or attributes map to a record type
named <tt>Identifier</tt>. Note
that <em>&#171;public&#187;</em>, <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>
and <em>&#171;utility&#187;</em> classes don't have identifiers.

<p>A class's instance data maps to a private record type named
<tt>Instance</tt>, with an access type <tt>Handle</tt>. In the case of
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em> classes, these are both declared in the
private part (in other words, they're only visible to operations of
the class itself). Both <em>&#171;public&#187;</em> and
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> classes have a private variable
<tt>This</tt> of type <tt>Handle</tt>, which accesses the only
instance of the class. See also under <a
href="attributes.html">Attributes</a>.

<p>Normal classes have a <tt><a name="create">Create</a></tt>
operation, returning a <tt>Handle</tt>. If the class's only
identifying attribute is of type <tt>Autonumber</tt>, <tt>Create</tt>
takes no parameters; otherwise it takes a single parameter of
type <tt>Identifier</tt>.

<p>They also have a pair of <tt>Delete</tt> operations; one takes a
parameter <tt>This</tt> of type <tt>Handle</tt>, the other takes a
single parameter of type <tt>Identifier</tt>.

<p>Non-<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>, non-<em>&#171;utility&#187;</em>
classes have a
<tt>Find</tt> operation:
<ul>

<li><em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> classes have a parameterless
<tt>Find</tt> operation returning a <tt>Handle</tt> (which can't be
<tt>null</tt>, unless you've forgotten to call
<tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</tt>),

<li>classes with multiplicity <i>0..1</i> have a parameterless
<tt>Find</tt> operation returning a <tt>Handle</tt> (which may be
<tt>null</tt>),

<li>other classes have a <tt>Find</tt> operation taking a single
parameter of type <tt>Identifier</tt> and returning a <tt>Handle</tt>
(you may get <tt>null</tt> if there aren't presently any instances
with that identifier).

</ul>

<p>Non-<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>, non-<em>&#171;utility&#187;</em>
classes have a package <tt>Vectors</tt>, which is an instantiation
of <tt>Ada.Containers.Vectors</tt> (or <tt>Bounded_Vectors</tt>, if
the maximum number of instances is known) for <tt>Handle</tt>s.

<!--
<p>Association classes
-->

<h3><a name="internals">Package internals</a></h3>

<p>In case operations may need them, ColdFrame automatically places
<tt>with</tt>s in the body of a class package for all class packages
where
<ul>

<li>the other class is a parent;

<li>the other class is a child;

<li>the other class is used as the type of an operation's parameter or
return;

<li>this class holds a referential attribute designating the other class.
<br>This will be expanded at some point to include all other classes
involved in associations.

</ul>

<p><i>more to come</i>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>If you're implementing operations of
a <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> or <i>0 .. 1</i> class,
use <tt>This</tt> instead of <tt>Find</tt>; it'll be quicker.

<p>The identifier is always a record type, even if there's only
one attribute in it, so you'll need an aggregate; if there <em>is</em>
only one attribute, you'll need to qualify the aggregate or use named
association, so that Ada can tell it's actually an aggregate and not
an expression: for <tt>Fruit</tt>, for instance,
<pre>
   Create ((ID => Apple));
</pre>
