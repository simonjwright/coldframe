<h1>ColdFrame: Classes</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>A class typically is an abstraction of something in the <a
href="domains.html ">domain</a> of interest. It represents the common
properties and behaviour shared by all instances of the class.

<p>Not all classes represent concrete concepts (such as <em>Cat</em>
or <em>Book</em>). It's common for classes to represent incidents
(<em>Button Press</em>), relationships (<em>Book Borrowing</em>) or
roles (<em>Hired Van</em>).

<p>See also:
<ul>
<li><a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>
<li><a href="operations.html">operations</a>
<li><a href="active-classes.html">active classes</a>
</ul>

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>A class is modelled, of course, by a UML class.

<p>In ColdFrame, not all UML "class" symbols represent what we're
discussing here:

<ul>

<li>you use the stereotype <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>, or one of the
shorthand stereotypes
<ul>
<li><em>&#171;callback&#187;</em>,
<li><em>&#171;counterpart&#187;</em>,
<li><em>&#171;discriminated&#187;</em>
</ul>
which indicate that the class symbol in fact represents a <a
href="types.html">type</a>.

<li>you use the stereotype <em>&#171;public&#187;</em> when the class
symbol in fact represents a callable interface between the domain and
other domains (a "class utility").
<br>Note, a &#171;public&#187; class is to a large extent part of the
intended implementation rather than part of the problem domain!
However, you'll probably only find &#171;public&#187; classes in
service domains, so it's arguable that they do correspond to a part of
the problem.

</ul>

<p>Given that, classes come in three flavours: normal, singleton and
utility.

<p>Utility classes have no instances (you could think of them as
representing a library of functions).

<p>A singleton class (marked <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>) always
has precisely one instance; you don't need to create it, and you can't
delete it.

<p>Normal classes start off with no instances; the instances have to
be created, and may be deleted.

<p>Instances of a normal class must be uniquely identifiable by some
<a href="attributes.html">attribute</a> or combination of
attributes. The identifying attributes, like any other attributes,
ought to be of non-composite types.

<p>For example, a <i>Book Edition</i> is uniquely identified by its
<i>ISBN</i>. This is an example of a <i>naming attribute</i>: <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Leon Starr</a> says

<blockquote>
[A naming attribute exists] not so much to describe, but to identify,
instances. [...] A naming attribute may or may not be sufficient to
uniquely identify instances of a class. For example, the attribute
<i>Employee Name</i> is a naming attribute, but it is possible to have
two employees with the same name.
</blockquote>

<p>In another example, a Vehicle Excise Disk (the round paper
certificate, to be displayed on the vehicle's windscreen, that shows
you've paid the UK road tax for the year) might be identified by the
combination of Vehicle Index Mark (the string of letters and digits on
the numberplate) and Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and
Validity Start Date then become "identifying attributes", whereas Date
Of Issue and Period Of Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in <a href="generalizations.html">inheritance
relationships</a>,
<li>associative classes,
<li>public classes,
<li>singletons,
<li>types or
<li>utility classes.
</ul>

<p>All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this,
ColdFrame doesn't follow <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML</a>; it seems
risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute <a href="types.html">type</a>
<tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like the Microsoft Access feature
it's named after): each newly-created instance gets a new value.

<h3>Use of Stereotypes</h3>

<p>Classes which represent user-defined <a href="types.html">types</a>
are marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>. (The
stereotypes <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em>, <em>&#171;counterpart&#187;</em>,
<em>&#171;discriminated&#187;</em> and <em>&#171;protected&#187;</em>
imply <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>).

<p>Classes of which there is always precisely one instance are marked
with the stereotype <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>Public classes, which are normally the only classes visible from
outside the Domain, are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>. They can have at most one instance (you
don't need to say <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>). Public classes
can't take part in
<a href="associations.html">associations</a>.

<p>For test support, it's possible to stereotype or tag a class
<em>&#171;visible-for-test&#187;</em>, which makes it visible from
outside the domain.

<p>Abstract classes (which must be parents in <a
href="generalizations.html">inheritance relationships</a>) may be
marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em>. This has no
effect on code generation at present (3.i.02).
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em> is an alternative to the use of the
<i>Abstract</i> checkbox in the Rose <i>Class Specification</i> dialog
(<i>Detail</i> tab).

<p><a href="active-classes.html">Active classes</a> (where each
instance is to be associated with a run-time thread or task) may be
marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;active&#187;</em> or, if
preferred, by setting the <i>Concurrency</i> attribute in the
<i>Detail</i> tab of the Rose specification dialog box to
<i>Active</i> (which is less immediately visible).

<h3><a name="tags">Tags</a></h3>

<p><tt>{ abbreviation = <i>abbrev</i> }</tt> specifies the class's
abbreviation. By default, the abbreviation is composed of the initial
letters of the full class name or, if the name is a single word, the
name prefixed with <tt>A_</tt> or <tt>An_</tt> as appropriate. This
rule wouldn't work for, for example, <i>New Threat</i> and <i>Non
Threat</i>.

<p><tt>{ max = <i>max-size</i> }</tt> specifies the maximum number
of instances that will coexist. This may provoke a different code
generation strategy.

<br>You can get the same effect by specifying a cardinality (or
multiplicity, depending on the version of Rose) of
<tt>0..<i>max-size</i></tt> under the Rose Class Specification
<i>Detail</i> tab. <tt>1..1</tt> is allowed as a shorthand for
&#171;singleton&#187;; <tt>1..n</tt> isn't allowed.

<p><tt>{ priority = <i>priority</i> }</tt> allows you to specify the
priority of each instance of an <a href="active-classes.html">active
class</a>, relative to the system's default priority (larger numbers
mean higher priority).

<p><tt>{ stack = <i>stack-size</i> }</tt> allows you to specify a
non-default stack size for each instance of an <a
href="active-classes.html">active class</a>.


<h2>Translation</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#library-structure">Ada library structure</a>
<li><a href="#externals">Package externals</a>
<li><a href="#internals">Package internals</a>
<li><a href="active-classes.html">Active classes</a>
</ul>

<h3><a name="library-structure">Ada library structure</a></h3>

<p>All the classes in a <a href="domains.html">domain</a> are
translated as first-level children of the domain package:

<pre>
   <i>private</i> package <i>Domain.Class</i> is
      ...
   end <i>Domain.Class</i>;
</pre>

<p>(<tt>private</tt> applies to all the classes bar those marked
<em>&#171;visible-for-test&#187;</em> and
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>).

<p>If the class is <em>&#171;public&#187;</em> or a
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>, that's it. For normal classes, the
following additional library units are generated:

<dd>A basic instantiation of the Booch Components for class
<tt>Handle</tt>s. Supports iteration.

<h3><a name="externals">Package externals</a></h3>

<p>A class's identifying attribute or attributes map to a record type
named <tt>Identifier</tt>. Note that 'utility',
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em> and <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> classes
don't have identifiers.

<p>A class's instance data maps to a private record type named
<tt>Instance</tt>, with an access type <tt>Handle</tt>. In the case of
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em> classes, these are both declared in the
private part (in other words, they're only visible to operations of
the class itself). Both <em>&#171;public&#187;</em> and
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> classes have a private variable
<tt>This</tt> of type <tt>Handle</tt>, which accesses the only
instance of the class. See also under <a
href="attributes.html">Attributes</a>.

<p>Normal classes have a <tt>Create</tt> operation, returning a
<tt>Handle</tt>. If the class's only identifying attribute is of type
<tt>Autonumber</tt>, <tt>Create</tt> takes no parameters; otherwise it
takes a single parameter of type <tt>Identifier</tt>.

<p>They also have a pair of <tt>Delete</tt> operations; one takes a
parameter <tt>This</tt> of type <tt>Handle</tt>, the other takes a
single parameter of type <tt>Identifier</tt>.

<p>Non-<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>, non-utility classes have a
<tt>Find</tt> operation:
<ul>

<li><em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> classes have a parameterless
<tt>Find</tt> operation returning a <tt>Handle</tt> (which can't be
<tt>null</tt>, unless you've forgotten to call
<tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</tt>),

<li>classes with multiplicity <i>0..1</i> have a parameterless
<tt>Find</tt> operation returning a <tt>Handle</tt> (which may be
<tt>null</tt>),

<li>other classes have a <tt>Find</tt> operation taking a single
parameter of type <tt>Identifier</tt> and returning a <tt>Handle</tt>
(you may get <tt>null</tt> if there aren't presently any instances
with that identifier).

</ul>

<h3><a name="internals">Package internals</a></h3>

<p>In case operations may need them, ColdFrame automatically places
<tt>with</tt>s in the body of a class package for all class packages
where
<ul>

<li>the other class is a parent;

<li>the other class is a child;

<li>the other class is used as the type of an operation's parameter or
return;

<li>this class holds a referential attribute designating the other class.
<br>This will be expanded at some point to include all other classes
involved in associations.

</ul>

<p><i>more to come</i>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>If you're implementing operations of a
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em> class, use <tt>This</tt> instead of
<tt>Find</tt>; it'll be quicker.

<p>The identifier is always a record type, even if there's only
one attribute in it, so you'll need an aggregate; if there <em>is</em>
only one attribute, you'll need to qualify the aggregate or use named
association, so that Ada can tell it's actually an aggregate and not
an expression: for <tt>Fruit</tt>, for instance,
<pre>
   Create ((ID => Apple));
</pre>
