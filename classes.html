<h1>ColdFrame: Classes</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>A class typically is an abstraction of something in the <a
href="domains.html ">domain</a> of interest. It represents the common
properties and behaviour shared by all instances of the class.

<p>Not all classes represent concrete concepts (such as <em>Cat</em>
or <em>Book</em>). It's common for classes to represent incidents
(<em>Button Press</em>), relationships (<em>Book Borrowing</em>) or
roles {<em>Hired Van</em>).

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>A class is modelled, of course, by a UML class.

<p>Not all UML "class" symbols represent what we're discussing here;
with ColdFrame, you use the stereotype <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> when
the class symbol in fact represents a type.

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of <a
href="attributes.html">attributes</a>. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk might be identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark and
Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start Date then
become "identifying attributes", whereas Date Of Issue and Period Of
Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in <a href="generalizations.html">inheritance
relationships</a>,
<li>associative classes,
<li>singletons, or
<li>types.
</ul>

All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this, ColdFrame
doesn't follow <a href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable
UML</a>; it seems risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute type <tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like
the Microsoft Access feature it's named after): each newly-created
instance gets a new value.
