<h1>ColdFrame: Generalizations</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The thinking behind ColdFrame is that instead of making code models
you should be making what <a
href="resources.html#analysis-patterns">Martin Fowler</a>, in Appendix
A1.1, calls "implicit specification models".

<p>One way of looking at it is that modelling ought to be, as far as
reasonable, independent of the software architecture (both the
implementation language and the support infrastructure). What we are
modelling is generalization. We may be able to implement
generalization using inheritance in our implementation language, but
there may be practical difficulties; perhaps we have to implement in
C; maybe we're using an SQL database to implement persistence; our
implementation language may not support
<em>multiple</em> inheritance.

<p>Another aspect is dynamic versus static classification.

<p>The major use of generalization (well, specialization) is to
classify aspects of the subject matter. Inheritance, as implemented in
C++ or other object-oriented programming languages, is fine for static
classification (subtyping Animal as Pig, Goat, Cow for example).

<p><a name="rentawreck"><img src="inheritance.gif"></a>

<p>However, a very useful analysis technique is dynamic classification
(<a href="resources.html#analysis-patterns">Fowler</a>
A1.3). Rent-a-Wreck has a fleet of vans, which are sometimes on
hire. We might want to model this as <i>Customer hires Van</i>, which
is biconditional (a known Customer may not have any Van on hire at the
moment; a Van may not be hired to anyone at the moment) and hence a
little vague. The model can be made crisper by subtyping Van into
Hired Van and Pool Van; now all Hired Vans have a Customer, so the
code doesn't need to check whether there's a Customer or not.

<p>The attribute <i>termination</i> only has meaning if the van is on
hire (it's the date when it's due back), so we shouldn't leave it
lying around in the parent <i>Van</i> class. Also, the association
<i>r3</i>, <i>Hired Van</i> <i>is-on-loan-to</i> <i>Customer</i> is
unconditional, which is good.

<p>Note also the way <i>r1</i>, which maintains the service history of
the <i>Van</i>, is independent of whether the <i>Van</i> is currently
hired out or in the pool.

<p>The problem with implementing this model using programming language
inheritance arises when the Van changes from being Pooled to being
Hired. There's only one code object, so you have to create a new
<i>HiredVan</i>, copy the relevant attributes from the old
<i>PoolVan</i> to it, break any associations with other objects
(for instance, the <i>Service</i> history), delete the old
<i>PoolVan</i> and remake the associations.

<p>ColdFrame adopts a halfway-house approach to this, combining the <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML (originally
Shlaer-Mellor) view of generalization</a> with dispatching and
inherited operations.

<p>Of course, there is a cost to dynamic classification; you have to
decide whether increased precision in the model is worth the extra run
time costs of maintaining the model.

<p>At present (11 June 2002), ColdFrame expects the set of child
instances to be complete, which is why <i>Pool Van</i> appears in the
model above. Every <i>Van</i> must be either a <i>Hired Van</i> or a
<i>Pool Van</i>. This only actually shows up in implementing
dispatching operations; if you try calling a dispatching operation for
an instance without a current child you'll get a
<tt>Constraint_Error</tt>. Often you'll find something interesting to
say about all the child classes; in the example, it seems likely that
only <i>Pool Van</i>s can be sent for servicing.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>You <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for child classes in
inheritance relationships.

<p>ColdFrame supports polymorphism. Instance operations marked
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em> are dispatched to the current child
(skipping down the inheritance tree until a concrete implementation is
found), while a child class receives upward-dispatching
implementations of all normal (non-<em>&#171;class&#187;</em>) concrete
parental instance operations.

<p>ColdFrame supports multiple inheritance, but not partitioned
inheritance. In spite of this, you need to name all the
generalization/specialization links in your class diagram,
<em>and all the links for a particular relationship must have the same
name</em> (<a href="#rentawreck"><i>r2</i> in the diagram</a>).

<h2>Translation</h2>

<h3>Basic mapping</h3>

<h4>Single inheritance</h4>

<p>In the parent class, an inheritance relationship <i>G</i> is mapped onto

<ul>

<li>an enumeration <tt><i>G</i>_Child_Class</tt>, whose literals are
the names of the child classes with <tt>_T</tt> appended plus a final
<tt>Null_T</tt>,

<li>a discriminated record <tt><i>G</i>_Child</tt>, with discriminant
of type <tt><i>G</i>_Child_Class</tt> defaulted to <tt>Null_T</tt>,
each branch selecting a <tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt> of the
appropriate type,

<li>Get and Set accessor operations (<tt>Get_<i>G</i>_Child</tt>,
<tt>Set_<i>G</i>_Child</tt>).

</ul>

<p><a href="#rentawreck">From the diagram</a>, we'd get

<pre>
   type R2_Child_Class is
     (Hired_Van_T,
      Pool_Van_T,
      Null_T);

   type R2_Child (Current : R2_Child_Class := Null_T) is record
      case Current is
         when Hired_Van_T =>
            HV : ColdFrame.Instances.Handle;
         when Pool_Van_T =>
            PV : ColdFrame.Instances.Handle;
         when Null_T => null;
      end case;
   end record;

   procedure Set_R2_Child (This : Handle; To_Be : R2_Child);

   function Get_R2_Child (This : Handle) return R2_Child;
</pre>

<p>In a child class, an inheritance relationship <i>G</i> is mapped onto

<ul>

<li>an identifying attribute named <tt><i>G</i>_Parent</tt> of type
<tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt>,

<li>a Get accessor <tt>Get_<i>G</i>_Parent</tt> (there's no Set,
because this is an identifying attribute).

</ul>

<p>The <tt>Create</tt> operation in a child class fixes up the
<tt><i>G</i>_Child</tt> record in the parent.

<p>The <tt>Delete</tt> operation in a parent class deletes the current
child, if any, recursively; the <tt>Delete</tt> operation in a child
class nulls out the <tt><i>G</i>_Child</tt> record in the parent.

<h4>Multiple inheritance</h4>

<p>There's no difference between multiple and single inheritance from
the point of view of a parent (ColdFrame disallows partitioned
inheritance trees, which in any case aren't really related to
<em>multiple</em> inheritance).

<p>For children, the implementation for single inheritance is repeated
for each parent. Note particularly that this means you get an
identifier with one identifying attribute for each parent.

<h3>Extended mapping</h3>

<p>There's <a href="generalizations-extended.html">additional
support</a>, particularly for dynamic classification (subtype
migration).

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>The fact that the relationships are managed using
<tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt> means that you need to do view
conversions rather more often than is quite friendly.

<pre>
   Child_H := Child.Create
      ((G_Parent =&gt; ColdFrame.Instances.Handle (Parent_H)));
</pre>

<p>If you're doing this a lot you may find a type renaming convenient:

<pre>
   subtype CIH is ColdFrame.Instances.Handle;
</pre>
