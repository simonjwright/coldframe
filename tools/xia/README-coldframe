This directory contains XIA-1.0.0 from McKae Technologies
(http://www.mckae.com), patched for use with ColdFrame.

The patches are contained in build_xia_as_library.diff in this
directory, and make the following changes:

* XIA.gpr is included, to build XIA as a library. It assumes that
  XML/Ada is available on ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

* Ada.Containers are used instead of the Booch Components.

* Some spec source files are modified to prevent style warnings in
  user code (the changes are to ensure consistency of casing, eg McKae
  throughout instead of Mckae in some places.)

* bench_xpath.adb and test_xpath.adb have been moved to the test/
  subdirectory, which includes test.gpr.
