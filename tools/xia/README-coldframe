This directory contains XIA-1.0.0 from McKae Technologies
(http://www.mckae.com), patched for use with ColdFrame.

The patches are contained in build_xia_as_library.diff in this
directory, and make the following changes:

* XIA.gpr is included, to build XIA as a library. It assumes that the
  Booch Components and XML/Ada are available on ADA_PROJECT_PATH.

* Some source files are modified to prevent style warnings in user
  code (the changes are to ensure consistency of casing, eg McKae
  throughout instead of Mckae in some places. Internal warnings
  haven't been suppressed, and will appear during initial builds.)

* bench_xpath.adb and test_xpath.adb have been moved to the test/
  subdirectory, which includes test.gpr.
