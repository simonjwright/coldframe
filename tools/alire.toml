The tools that are built from Ada source using Alire are

* `coldframe_hash_strings_generate`, which generates the Character_Hash table in the private part of `ColdFrame.Hash.Strings` (a one-off, included for reference).
* `normalize_xmi`, which takes an XML Model Interchange file (`.xmi`) generated by ArgoUML or TextUML and converts it into ColdFrame's 'normalized' (`.norm`) format, described in `../doc/ColdFrame-norm.xsd`.
