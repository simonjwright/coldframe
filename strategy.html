<h1>ColdFrame: Strategy</h1>

<p>It's fundamental to the idea of ColdFrame that you don't need to
build a design model by decorating your clean, beautiful analysis
model with all sorts of support clutter (lists, queues etc). The
software architect decides how analysis models are to be translated
into code, and a mechanical process (applied either by a programmer or
by a program) applies the rules.

<p>That isn't to say that you can be slapdash about your models. Often
people will treat the modelling phase as if it were a sketchy
whiteboard activity; you can't do that if the model is going to be
translated directly into code (not that that was ever a good idea!)

<p>Examples of commercial products which take this approach are
Software through Pictures from <a
href="http://www.aonix.com/">Aonix</a> and <a
href="http://www.artisansw.com/">ARTiSAN Software</a>'s Real-Time
Modeler.

<p>It's important that the tool lets the architect adopt different
strategies depending on circumstances. For example, the way that
ColdFrame generates code for a class is changed markedly if you apply
the stereotype <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>This need makes it very advantageous to have a complete programming
environment available while scripting the output. Predetermined
substitution variables aren't likely to fill the bill. Pattern
matching facilities will help.
