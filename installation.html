<h1>ColdFrame: Installation</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>ColdFrame uses:

<ul>

0.35, or <a href="textuml.pdf">TextUML</a> (for modelling)

<li><a href="https://www.adacore.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer">GNAT</a> (an Ada 95/2005/2012/2022 compiler; must support
Ada2005 or later)

<li><a href="https://python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer">Python 3</a>

<li><a href="https://www.saxonica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener

rel="noopener noreferrer">XIA</a> (XPath in Ada library, for UML
processing)

<li><a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer">PLY</a> (Python Lex-Yacc, for TextUML processing)

<li><a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/tcladashell"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TclAdaShell</a>, for running
examples

<li><a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/scripted_testing"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scripted Testing</a>,
likewise

<li><a href="https://www.graphviz.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer">Graphviz</a>, for diagram generation.

</ul>

<h2>Modelling tool setup</h2>

These are documented separately:

<ul>
<li> <a href="argouml-installation.html">ArgoUML</a>
<li> <a href="textuml-installation.html">TextUML</a>
<li> <a href="saxon-installation.html">Saxon HE</a>
</ul>

<h2>ColdFrame setup</h2>

<p>First, either download ColdFrame from
the <a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/coldframe/releases"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Releases</a> folder, or
clone
it (<code>git&nbsp;clone&nbsp;git@github.com:simonjwright/coldframe.git</code>
or <code>git&nbsp;clone&nbsp;https://github.com/simonjwright/coldframe.git</code>),
and step into the <tt>coldframe-Release_yyyymmdd</tt> or
just <tt>coldframe</tt> directory, as appropriate.

<p>Say
<pre>
<i>$</i> make setup
</pre>

<p>Amongst other things, this builds the tools supplied in source form
in the <tt>tools/</tt> subdirectory.

<h2>Environment variables</h2>

<p>These are the main environment variables that can be used to
control ColdFrame's code generation. The indicated defaults are as set
up in the Makefile <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>. They can all be overridden
except for <tt>ADA_PROJECT_PATH</tt> (which <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>
extends).

<h2>Your Makefile</h2>

<p>Your project will in general consist of a number
of <a href="domains.html">domains</a>, and (unlike some other
modelling tools, such as Rational Rose) ArgoUML offers no facility to
keep the domains in separately-controlled files. Your choice is then
to have one UML file per domain, one per project, or somethng in
between.

<p>ColdFrame supports having multiple domains per UML file.

<p>Create a <tt>Makefile</tt> in the directory where your generated
<tt><i>Domain</i>.gen/</tt> files (will) live (next to your
implementation <tt><i>Domain</i>.impl/</tt> files).

<p>It should begin by defining where your model (<tt>.uml</tt>) files
live, so as to override ColdFrame's default:

<pre>
MODELS = <i>/where/ever</i>
</pre>

<p>and then include ColdFrame's standard Makefile:

<pre>
include $(COLDFRAME)/Makefile.inc
</pre>

<p>Next, define the domains: ColdFrame creates the
intermediate <tt>.norm</tt> file names as it does other names in the
model, by normalizing case and replacing spaces by underscores. Let's
suppose that the model is <tt><i>/where/ever/</i>Model.uml</tt> and it
contains domains <i>House Management</i> and <i>Digital IO</i> (the
latter containing a child package stereotyped
&#171;domain-interface&#187; called <i>Digital IO Interface</i> with
the tag <tt>{name=Digital IO}</tt>, see the section
on <a href="testing.html#stubs">testing with stubs</a>):

<pre>
DOMAINS = House_Management Digital_IO Digital_IO_Interface
</pre>

<p>Tell ColdFrame about the relationship between <tt>Model.uml</tt>
and the domains using the incantation

<pre>
$(addsuffix .norm,$(DOMAINS)): $(MODELS)/Model.norm-stamp ;
</pre>

<p>or, if you're using TextUML,

<pre>
$(addsuffix .norm,$(DOMAINS)): $(MODELS)/Model.tuml-norm-stamp ;
</pre>

<p>(or, of course, both). In either case, <em>do not</em> omit the
space before the semicolon.

<p>Later on, you'll add rules to build the executables, but to start
with you can just generate the code:

<pre>
all:: $(addsuffix .gen,$(DOMAINS))
</pre>

<h3>Creating your build directories</h3>

<p>If you have a recent GNAT you can use the <tt>-p</tt> flag to
tell <tt>gnatmake</tt> or <tt>gprbuild</tt> to create any needed
directories as required.

<h3>Creating
a <a href="https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gprbuild/html/gprbuild_ug/gprbuild_ug.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNAT
Project</a> file</h3>

<p>If you don't need to override any of the <tt>ColdFrame.Project</tt>
source, your project file can be pretty simple: the supplied
<tt>Event_Test.gpr</tt> (in the <tt>test/</tt> subdirectory) is

<pre>
with "ColdFrame";
with "Options";
with "aunit";

project Event_Test is

  for Main use ("event_test-harness");

  for Exec_Dir use ".";

  for Source_Dirs use
    ("<i>Event_Test.impl"</i>,
     "<i>Event_Test.gen</i>",
     "<i>Event_Test.test</i>");

  for Object_Dir use ".build";
  package Builder renames Options.Builder;
  package Compiler renames Options.Compiler;
  package Binder renames Options.Binder;
  package Linker renames Options.Linker;

end Event_Test;
</pre>

<p>Add further domains as required, of course.

<h3>Overriding <tt>ColdFrame.Project</tt> source</h3>

<p>If you need to override some of the Ada source code in the
<tt>$COLDFRAME/project</tt> directory, life becomes complicated
because you have to avoid circularity and having multiple occurrences
of the same file; you can't use the supplied
<tt>ColdFrame.gpr</tt>.

<p>Suppose your overriding source is in
<tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject/project</tt>; change directory to
<tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject</tt> and say
<pre>
$ $COLDFRAME/scripts/install-project
</pre>

<p>This will place those of ColdFrame's files that you haven't
overridden in <tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject/inherited</tt>.

<p>The project file now looks like

<p><pre>
with "Options";
with "aunit";

project Event_Test is

  for Main use ("event_test-harness");

  for Exec_Dir use ".";

  Project_Base = external ("HOME") & "/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject";

  for Source_Dirs use
    (
     "<i>Event_Test.impl"</i>,
     "<i>Event_Test.gen</i>",
     "<i>Event_Test.test</i>",
     external ("COLDFRAME") & "/lib",
     Project_Base & "/project",
     Project_Base & "/inherited"
    );

  for Object_Dir use ".build";
  package Builder renames Options.Builder;
  package Compiler renames Options.Compiler;
  package Binder renames Options.Binder;
  package Linker renames Options.Linker;

end Event_Test;
</pre>

<h2>Windows notes</h2>

<p>ColdFrame is built on a Unix system and requires typical Unix
utilities in order to function.

<p>A Unix-like environment which has proved effective in the past
is <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cygwin</a>.

<p>When installing Cygwin, choose the 'developer' option.
