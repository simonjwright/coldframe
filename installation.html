<h1>ColdFrame: Installation</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>ColdFrame uses:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a>
or <a href="textuml.pdf">TextUML</a> for modelling

<li><a href="https://www.adacore.com">GNAT</a> (an Ada 95/2005/2012
compiler; must support Ada2005)

<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/">Saxon</a> (an
XSLT processor)

</ul>

<p>The <tt>examples/</tt> also
require <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcladashell/">TclAdaShell</a>
to be installed on <tt>ADA_PROJECT_PATH</tt>.

<h2>ColdFrame setup</h2>

<p>First, unpack ColdFrame (it unpacks into a
directory <tt>cf-<i>yyyymmdd</i></tt>, for
example <tt>cf-20120218</tt>), and enter that directory.

<p>If you're running Debian 6 (<i>squeeze</i>), there are a couple of
changes needed (<i>gnatmake</i> doesn't
understand <tt>external_as_list()</tt> in a Project file): say
<pre>
<i>$</i> patch -p1 &lt;debian-6.diff
</pre>

<p>In all cases, say
<pre>
<i>$</i> make setup
</pre>

<p>This builds the tools supplied in source form in
the <tt>tools/</tt> subdirectory.

<h2>Modelling tool setup</h2>

<p><a href="argouml-installation.html">ArgoUML</a>
and <a href="textuml-installation.html">TextUML</a> installation are
documented separately.

<h2>Environment variables</h2>

<p>These are the main environment variables that can be used to
control ColdFrame's code generation. The indicated defaults are as set
up in the Makefile <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>. They can all be overridden
except for <tt>ADA_PROJECT_PATH</tt> (which <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>
extends).

<tr><td>ADA_PROJECT_PATH
<td>Where
your <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/GNAT-Project-Manager.html">GNAT

location to your setting.

<td>The list of case exceptions to be used when generating code (for
example, "GNAT").
<td>$SCRIPTS/emacs_case_exceptions

<tr><td>COLDFRAME
<td>Where ColdFrame is installed (overridden in the Makefiles); set it
to, for example, <tt><i>/where/ever/</i>cf-<i>20110720</i></tt>

<td>Where the <tt>.rr</tt> files, made by preprocessing
ArgoUML's <tt>.uml</tt> files, are to be placed/found.

<td>no

<tr><td>GENERATE_STUBS
<td>Should stub code be generated instead of the normal code?
<td>no

<tr><td>GNATCHOP
<td>Older ColdFrame projects may have used <tt>Interface</tt> as a
name; it became a keyword in Ada 2005. Modern versions
of <tt>gnatchop</tt> need to be told to adopt Ada95 rules, but older
versions wouldn't understand the flag. Set
to <tt>gnatchop -gnat95</tt> if this is the case.

<td>Where model files are located (to be overridden with the location
of a project's model files).
<td>$COLDFRAME/models

<h2>Your Makefile</h2>

<p>Your project will in general consist of a number
of <a href="domains.html">domains</a>, and (unlike some other
modelling tools, such as Rational Rose) ArgoUML offers no facility to
keep the domains in separately-controlled files. Your choice is then
to have one UML file per domain, one per project, or somethng in
between.

<p>ColdFrame supports having multiple domains per UML file.

<p>Create a <tt>Makefile</tt> in the directory where your generated
<tt><i>Domain</i>.gen/</tt> files (will) live (next to your
implementation <tt><i>Domain</i>.impl/</tt> files).

<p>It should begin by defining where your model (<tt>.uml</tt>) files
live, so as to override ColdFrame's default:

<pre>
MODELS = <i>/where/ever</i>
</pre>

<p>and then include ColdFrame's standard Makefile:

<pre>
include $(COLDFRAME)/Makefile.inc
</pre>

<p>Next, define the domains: ColdFrame creates the
intermediate <tt>.norm</tt> file names as it does other names in the
model, by normalizing case and replacing spaces by underscores. Let's
suppose that the model is <tt><i>/where/ever/</i>Model.uml</tt> and it
contains domains <i>House Management</i> and <i>Digital IO</i> (the
latter containing a child package stereotyped
&#171;domain-interface&#187; called <i>Digital IO Interface</i> with
the tag <tt>{name=Digital IO}</tt>, see the section
on <a href="testing.html#stubs">testing with stubs</a>):

<pre>
DOMAINS = House_Management Digital_IO Digital_IO_Interface
</pre>

<p>Tell ColdFrame about the relationship between <tt>Model.uml</tt>
and the domains using the incantation

<pre>
$(addsuffix .norm,$(DOMAINS)): $(MODELS)/Model.norm-stamp ;
</pre>

<p>or, if you're using TextUML,

<pre>
$(addsuffix .norm,$(DOMAINS)): $(MODELS)/Model.tuml-norm-stamp ;
</pre>

<p>(or, of course, both). In either case, <em>do not</em> omit the
space before the semicolon.

<p>Later on, you'll add rules to build the executables, but to start
with you can just generate the code:

<pre>
all:: $(addsuffix .gen,$(DOMAINS))
</pre>

<h3>Creating your build directories</h3>

<p>If you have a recent GNAT you can use the <tt>-p</tt> flag to
tell <tt>gnatmake</tt> or <tt>gprbuild</tt> to create any needed
directories as required.

<h3>Creating
a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/GNAT-Project-Manager.html">GNAT
Project</a> file</h3>

<p>If you don't need to override any of the <tt>ColdFrame.Project</tt>
source, your project file can be pretty simple: the supplied
<tt>Event_Test.gpr</tt> (in the <tt>test/</tt> subdirectory) is

<pre>
with "ColdFrame";
with "Options";
with "aunit";

project Event_Test is

  for Main use ("event_test-harness");

  for Exec_Dir use ".";

  for Source_Dirs use
    ("<i>Event_Test.impl"</i>,
     "<i>Event_Test.gen</i>",
     "<i>Event_Test.test</i>");

  for Object_Dir use ".build";
  package Builder renames Options.Builder;
  package Compiler renames Options.Compiler;
  package Binder renames Options.Binder;
  package Linker renames Options.Linker;

end Event_Test;
</pre>

<p>Add further domains as required, of course.

<h3>Overriding <tt>ColdFrame.Project</tt> source</h3>

<p>If you need to override some of the Ada source code in the
<tt>$COLDFRAME/project</tt> directory, life becomes complicated
because you have to avoid circularity and having multiple occurrences
of the same file; you can't use the supplied
<tt>ColdFrame.gpr</tt>.

<p>Suppose your overriding source is in
<tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject/project</tt>; change directory to
<tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject</tt> and say
<pre>
$ $COLDFRAME/scripts/install-project
</pre>

<p>This will place those of ColdFrame's files that you haven't
overridden in <tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject/inherited</tt>.

<p>The project file now looks like

<p><pre>
with "Options";
with "aunit";

project Event_Test is

  for Main use ("event_test-harness");

  for Exec_Dir use ".";

  Project_Base = external ("HOME") & "/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject";

  for Source_Dirs use
    (
     "<i>Event_Test.impl"</i>,
     "<i>Event_Test.gen</i>",
     "<i>Event_Test.test</i>",
     external ("COLDFRAME") & "/lib",
     Project_Base & "/project",
     Project_Base & "/inherited"
    );

  for Object_Dir use ".build";
  package Builder renames Options.Builder;
  package Compiler renames Options.Compiler;
  package Binder renames Options.Binder;
  package Linker renames Options.Linker;

end Event_Test;
</pre>

<h2>Windows notes</h2>

<p>ColdFrame is built on a Unix system and requires typical Unix
utilities in order to function.

<p>A Unix-like environment which has proved effective in the past
is <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.

<p>When installing Cygwin, choose the 'developer' option.
