<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Many systems use the Layered approach to architecture, and it's
likely that a ColdFrame-based system will do the same. In any case,
there has to be support for interactions between different Domains
(subject matters).

<p>To avoid awkward dependencies, both at the design level and in the
translated code, ColdFrame supports <i>callbacks</i>. Another name for
this concept is the <i>Observer</i> pattern.

<p>With callbacks, the lower-level domain provides a facility so that
higher-level domains can <i>register</i> to be informed when a
particular event occurs; when it does occur, the lower-level domain
<i>calls the callbacks</i>, which notifies the registered higher-level
domains (clients) without needing to know anything about them.

<p>A domain can <i>deregister</i> from a callback, though it would be
more normal to connect at initialization and stay connected.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<h3>Server-side</h3>

<p>In the lower-level domain, create a <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>
corresponding to the event that clients need notifying about.

<p>Mark it as a callback type by

<ul>

<li>Using <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em>. This is a shorthand for

<li>Using <em>&#171;type, callback&#187;</em>. This is rather clunky.

<li>Using <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> and including the tag
<i>{callback}</i>.

</ul>

<p>Either the first or third is neat; which to use depends on how
important it is to know that this is a callback type just from the
diagram. Since callbacks are an important part of the domain's
interface, it's probably best to use the first. You could use a colour
convention (callback types are <font color='purple'>mauve</font> ...)

<h3>Client-side</h3>

<p>If it's not a basic type (such as <i>Boolean</i>), import the
callback <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> from the server domain
(<i>{imported = Server}</i>).

<p>In an appropriate class, create a <em>&#171;class&#187;</em>
operation, taking a single (<tt>in</tt>) parameter of the callback
type, to act as the receiver.

<h2>Translation</h2>

For a callback type <i>CB</i>, ColdFrame generates an instantiation:
<pre>
   package <i>Domain</i>.CB_Callback
   is new ColdFrame.Callbacks
     (T => <i>Domain</i>.CB);
</pre>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p><a href="event-use.html">Here's an example of mixing callbacks and
events</a>.

<p>If all you want to say is that something has happened, mark your
<em>&#171;callback&#187;</em> type <i>{null}</i>. ColdFrame generates
a <tt>null record</tt> declaration. To create an instance of a null
record (to call the callbacks with), say <tt>(null record)</tt>.

<p>Don't bother to deregister for callbacks during AUnit test
teardown; ColdFrame automatically does this for you.
