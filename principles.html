<h1>ColdFrame: Principles</h1>

The viewpoint from which I've approached this project is that of
Shlaer-Mellor OOA. Some people would categorise this as clunky ("based
on database theory"), but for me my first encounter with OOA was an
"aha!"  moment.

<p>You'll find much more on the OOA approach at the <a
href="http://www.projtech.com/">Project Technology</a> and <a
href="http://www.kc.com/">Kennedy-Carter</a> sites. For the moment,
though, the important points are:

<ul>

<li>partition the problem space into independent subject matters
(domains);

<li>the Information Model (UML tools' Logical Model) is key;

<li>treat software architecture (how to implement the analysis model)
as another independent domain;

<li>generation of code according to the rules of the software
architecture should be automated as far as possible.

</ul>

You can see a set of <a href="use-cases.html">Use Cases</a>, written
basically from the viewpoint of the <i>Analyst</i> actor.
