<h1>ColdFrame: Principles</h1>

<p>The viewpoint from which I've approached this project is that of
Shlaer-Mellor OOA. Some people would categorise this as clunky ("based
on database theory"), but for me my first encounter with OOA was an
"aha!"  moment.

<p>You'll find much more on the OOA approach at
the <a href="http://www.mentor.com/products/sm/bridgepoint/">BridgePoint</a>
(was Project Technology)
and <a href="http://www.abstractsolutions.co.uk/">Abstract
Solutions</a> (was Kennedy-Carter) sites. For the moment, though, the
important points are:

<ul>

<li>partition the problem space into independent subject matters
(domains);

<li>the Information Model (UML tools' Logical Model) is key;

<li>treat software architecture (how to implement the analysis model)
as another independent domain;

<li>generation of code according to the rules of the software
architecture should be automated as far as possible.

</ul>

<p>You can see a set of <a href="use-cases.html">Use Cases</a>,
written basically from the viewpoint of the <i>Analyst</i>
actor. <i>[I've just been on a Use Case workshop; I don't think these
are really Use Cases. Still, you may find them helpful.]</i>
