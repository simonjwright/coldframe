<h2 class="chapter" id="Introduction-1">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>When code is automatically generated from a model (in the present case,
a UML model), there are two approaches:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>Use a Design Model</dt>
<dd>
<p>A design model is derived from an analysis model by adding support
classes to map the analysis model to the Software Architecture
(see <a class="pxref" href="#Software-Architecture">Software Architecture</a>). An example would be a container for all
the instances of a given class.
</p>
<p>A tool which uses this approach is <a class="uref" href="https://www.rational.com/">Rational</a> Rose.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Use an Analysis model</dt>
<dd>
<p>An analysis model contains classes and relationships that are part of
the subject matter of the analyzed subsystem. Code which supports the
execution of the model (for example, navigation from an instance of one
class through an association to find the set of corresponding instances
of another class) is automatically generated.
</p>
<p>Tools which use this approach include Software through Pictures from
<a class="uref" href="https://www.aonix.com/">Aonix</a>, Rhapsody from I-Logix, xUML from
<a class="uref" href="https://www.abstractsolutions.co.uk/">Abstract Solutions</a> (was
Kennedy-Carter), BridgePoint from
<a class="uref" href="https://www.mentor.com/products/sm/bridgepoint">Mentor Graphics</a>
(was Project Technology; now open-sourced), and the present project.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Automatically-generated support code comes in several flavours:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>Explicitly-generated</dt>
<dd>
<p>The code generation process writes out new code. An example is the
creation of a record structure to correspond to instance attributes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Instantiation</dt>
<dd>
<p>The new code is an instantiation of an existing generic component.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Derivation</dt>
<dd>
<p>The new code is an extension of an existing (base) component.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This set of Use Cases (well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m calling them!) covers the
requirements to be met by the Software Architecture (see <a class="pxref" href="#Software-Architecture">Software Architecture</a>), particularly by supporting components.
</p>
<p>The Actor concerned is the analyst who specifies the logic of operations
or actions. The programmer who implements these specifications (or, in
an advanced tool such as iUML or BridgePoint, implements the mechanisms
which provide full translation) is, rather, concerned with building
components to meet the requirements expressed here, and (eventually)
with using them.
</p>
<p>No distinction is made at this point between generic and base
components.

<h2 class="chapter" id="General-considerations-1">2 General considerations</h2>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t possible to maintain all the invariants of the model (for
example, constraints on relationships) within any given operation; on
the other hand, the analyst must not allow any operation to complete
with the model in an inconsistent state.

<p>The existence of an Instance must be independent of how many copies of

</div>
<h3 class="section" id="Create-an-Instance-1">3.1 Create an Instance</h3>

<p>When an Instance of a Class is to be created, the analyst specifies a
set of attributes which cover the Class&rsquo; Identifier
(see <a class="pxref" href="#Identifier">Identifier</a>).
</p>
<p>Once the Instance has been created (with default values for
non-identifier attributes), other attributes are set.
</p>
<p>It would be possible to support any legal combination of attributes
(besides the identifying attributes, which must be supplied); this is
likely to be prohibitively complex, unless the implementation language
allows default values for subprogram parameters. An acceptable
alternative strategy would be to require that all the attributes be
supplied at once.

<h3 class="section" id="Delete-an-Instance-1">3.2 Delete an Instance</h3>

<p>The prime way of deleting an Instance is to ask its Class to delete
it. This could either be in terms of the complete Identifier
(see <a class="pxref" href="#Identifier">Identifier</a>) or by using a valid selected Instance.
</p>
<p>An Instance can be asked to delete itself; this will resolve into the
Class operation discussed above.

<h3 class="section" id="Access-an-Instance-1">3.3 Access an Instance</h3>

<p>There are five (any advance on five?) ways of getting a single Instance:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>By creating it.

</li><li>By querying its Class using the identifier (see <a class="pxref" href="#Identifier">Identifier</a>).

</li><li>During iteration over a set of Instances.

</li><li>By navigating from a single Instance to the &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;0..1&rdquo; end
of an Association (see <a class="pxref" href="#Associations">Associations</a>). Note, the latter can result in
&ldquo;None&rdquo; as a valid answer.

</li><li>By navigating an Inheritance relationship from a single Instance
(see <a class="pxref" href="#Inheritance-relationships">Inheritance relationships</a>).

</li></ul>

<p>Once the Instance has been accessed, various operations are possible:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Read the values of attributes.

</li><li>Update the values of non-identifying attributes.

</li><li>Delete the Instance.

<p>Some operations (see see <a class="pxref" href="#Access-an-Instance">Access an Instance</a>) result in single
Instances; others result in (possibly empty) sets of Instances. These
include:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Querying the Class using a non-identifying subset of the
attributes.

</li><li>Navigating from a single Instance to the &ldquo;1..n&rdquo; or &ldquo;0..n&rdquo; end

</div>
<h3 class="section" id="Operate-on-a-set-of-Instances-1">3.5 Operate on a set of Instances</h3>

<p>Given a set of Instances (which includes the set of all the Instances),
the analyst must be able to specify operations on the set.
</p>
<p>In some cases these may be predetermined (for example, determine the
number of members of the set).
</p>
<p>In other cases the actual operation is analyst-specified. Variations to
consider include:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Perform a read-only operation on each member: for example, print
all Policies.

</li><li>Update each member: for example, apply increment to terminal bonus.

</li><li>Delete each member: for example, delete expired Policies.

</li><li>Navigate from each member: for example, collect the Policy Holder&rsquo;s
address details.

</li></ul>

<p>The above list is expressed as though the operation must apply to each
set member. Clearly this isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case; however, it may
often be cleaner to perform a more rigorous selection first and then
apply the operation to all the members of the result set.

<h2 class="chapter" id="Associations-1">4 Associations</h2>

<p>In some simple cases it may be possible to implement an association
between instances of two classes (or two instances of the same class)
without introducing a &ldquo;third party&rdquo;. In most cases, though, a third
party class will be necessary.
</p>
<p>For example, if it is (or may be) necessary to navigate the association
in either direction, language rules may well prohibit the mutual
visibility that would be necessary (Ada 95 doesn&rsquo;t permit this unless
the &ldquo;with type&rdquo; feature is implemented).

<h3 class="section" id="Create-an-association-1">4.1 Create an association</h3>

<p>Given two distinct instances (is that true? is it possible for an
instance to be associated with itself?), the analyst can require that
they be linked via an association. In some cases (eg, unconditional
associations), instances must be associated. Ideally some form of model
integrity check should be supported. This should include checks that no
extant association involving either instance already exists.
</p>
<p>Normally it will be obvious which end is which; this won&rsquo;t be so for
reflexive associations. It must be possible to specify which is which:
the role names (phrases) may prove useful.

<p>There is no special support required for chained navigations.

<p>If an association is conditional, it is necessary to support the concept
