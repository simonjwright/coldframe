<h1>ColdFrame: Conversion to standard form</h1>

<p>ColdFrame's "standard form" uses a home-grown <a
href="ColdFrame-norm.xsd">schema</a> rather than the standard XMI
Metadata Interchange (XMI) one.

<p>The processing is done using the Ada
program <tt>normalize_xmi</tt>, which uses
the <a href="resources.html#xml">XIA</a> (XPath In Ada) package to
access the XMI in the ArgoUML <tt>.uml</tt> file.

<!--
<p>You can see a <a href="error-messages.html">listing and explanation
of error and warning messages</a> that may appear.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p><tt>normalize_xmi</tt> takes the options

<dl>

<dt><tt>-c <i>filename</i></tt>

<dd>Specifies the name of one or more case-exceptions files.

<br>If there is more than one file, separate them using a colon
<tt>:</tt> on Unix, a semicolon <tt>;</tt> on Windows.

<br>The file format and the casing rules are as used by
Emacs <tt>ada-mode</tt>.

<br>Each line contains a single specification of a desired
casing. <tt>ColdFrame</tt> means that all occurrences of the string
<tt>coldframe</tt>, in any case, as the whole of an identifier will be
capitalized as given.

<br>You have to indicate which are "substring exceptions", so if you
want <tt>io</tt> to be capitalized as <tt>IO</tt> even if it occurs in
<tt>text_io</tt>, resulting in <tt>Text_IO</tt>, you have to write
<tt>*IO</tt> in the exceptions file.

<br>Default is to do "title case" casing always (so <tt>text io</tt>
comes out as <tt>Text_Io</tt>).

<br>The Make variable is <tt>CASE_EXCEPTIONS</tt>, default
is <tt>$(COLDFRAME)/scripts/emacs_case_exceptions</tt>.
