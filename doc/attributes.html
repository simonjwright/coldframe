<h1>ColdFrame: Attributes</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>An attribute holds a property of an object (either one per
instance, for example the Accession Number of a Book in a Library, or
per class, for example the <em>next</em> Accession Number to be used).

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk (a UK thing, up until October 2014: the circular document you
displayed on your car's windscreen to show you'd paid the annual road
tax) might be identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark (the
licence plate number) and Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and
Validity Start Date then become "identifying attributes", whereas Date
Of Issue and Period Of Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in inheritance relationships,
<li>associative classes,
<li>singletons, or
<li>types.
</ul>

<p>All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this, ColdFrame
doesn't follow <a href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable
UML</a>; it seems risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute type <tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like
the Microsoft Access feature it's named after): each newly-created
instance gets a new value.

<h3>Types</h3>

<p>If a <a href="types.html">&#171;datatype&#187; class</a> has
attributes, it corresponds to a C <tt>struct</tt> or an Ada
<tt>record</tt>.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>Attributes are, of course, modelled as attributes of a UML class.

<p>In UML, an attribute is expressed as
<pre>
&#171;stereotype&#187; <font color="red">visibility name</font> [multiplicity] <font color="red">: type-expression</font> = initial-value {property-string}
</pre>

<p>where the red parts are mandatory.

<p>ColdFrame doesn't support <i>multiplicity</i>; you'll either need
to use array <a href="types.html">types</a> <font color="red">(not yet
implemented with ArgoUML)</font> or
an <a href="associations.html">association</a>.

<p>The <i>property-string</i> (a tagged value) isn't supported.

<p>Attributes of classes can be <i>class</i> attributes, ie there is a
single value shared by all instances. Indicate this by checking
the <i>ownerScope</i> checkbox in the <i>modifiers</i> section of the
ArgoUML <i>Properties</i> tab.

<h3>Stereotypes</h3>

<dl>

<dt><em>&#171;aliased&#187;</em>
<dd>The attribute is to be stored in such a way that its address can
be taken (in Ada, <tt>'Access</tt>).

<dt><em>&#171;atomic&#187;</em>
<dd>The attribute must be read from memory or written to memory each
time it is accessed, like <tt>volatile</tt>, but additionally in such
a way that it's proof against concurrent access.
<br>The implementation may limit the size of objects that can be
treated as atomic.

<dt><em>&#171;id&#187;</em>
<dd>The attribute is an identifying attribute.

<br>The tag <tt><a name="formalizes">{formalizes</a>
= <i>association-name</i>}</tt> indicates that the attribute is a
referential attribute.

<br>This is needed when the attribute has to be specified by the
analyst (normally, ColdFrame can manage references as required).

<br>Consider R8, Licence is-issued-by Licensing Office. The identifier
of Licence consists of the licence number and also the issuing
Licensing Office, since the various offices don't use disjoint licence
number ranges. In this case, we'd specify the attributes as
<pre>
&#171;id&#187; Number : Positive
&#171;id&#187; Issuing_Office : Licensing_Office {formalizes=R8}
</pre>

<dt><em>&#171;volatile&#187;</em>
<dd>The attribute must be read from memory or written to memory each
time it is accessed.

</dl>

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>Attributes of types are implemented as Ada record components.

<p>Ordinary attributes of classes are implemented in the "instance
record", accessed as <tt>This.<i>attribute-name</i></tt>.

<p>Class attributes are implemented as variables in the private part
of the class package, and are accessed directly by name.

<!--
<p>If the attribute's type is known to be an array, the <i>{atomic}</i> and
<i>{volatile}</i> tags are translated to <tt>pragma
Atomic_Components</tt> or
<tt>pragma Volatile_Components</tt> respectively.
