<h1>ColdFrame: Installation</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>ColdFrame uses:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a>

<li><a href="http://www.adacore.com">GNAT</a> (an Ada 95/2005/2012
compiler; must support Ada2005)

<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/">Saxon</a> (an
XSLT processor)

<li>The <a href="http://booch95.sourceforge.net/index.html">Booch
Components</a> (an Ada 95 container library, compatible with Ada2005)

</ul>

<h2>ColdFrame setup</h2>

<p>Once you've unpacked ColdFrame (it unpacks into a
directory <tt>cf-<i>yyyymmdd</i></tt>, for
example <tt>cf-20120218</tt>), enter that directory and run
<pre>
   <i>$</i> make setup
</pre>

<p>This builds the tools supplied in source form in
the <tt>tools/</tt> subdirectory.

<h2>ArgoUML setup</h2>

<p>ArgoUML installation is
documented <a href="argouml-installation.html">separately</a>.

<h2>Environment variables</h2>

<p>These are the main environment variables that can be used to
control ColdFrame's code generation. The indicated defaults are as set
up in the Makefile <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>. They can all be overridden
except for <tt>ADA_PROJECT_PATH</tt> (which <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>
extends).

your <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/GNAT-Project-Manager.html">GNAT

<h2>Your Makefile</h2>

<p>Your project will in general consist of a number
of <a href="domains.html">domains</a>, and (unlike some other
modelling tools, such as Rational Rose) ArgoUML offers no facility to
keep the domains in separately-controlled files. The choice is then to
have one UML file per domain, one per project, or somethng in between.

<p>ColdFrame supports having multiple domains per UML file.

<p>Create a <tt>Makefile</tt> in the directory where your generated
<tt><i>Domain</i>.gen/</tt> files (will) live (next to your
implementation <tt><i>Domain</i>.impl/</tt> files).

<p>It should begin by defining where your model (<tt>.uml</tt>) files
live, so as to override ColdFrame's default:

<pre>
   MODELS = <i>/where/ever</i>
</pre>

<p>and then include ColdFrame's standard Makefile:

<pre>
   include $(COLDFRAME)/Makefile.inc
</pre>

<p>Next, define the domains: ColdFrame creates the
intermediate <tt>.norm</tt> file names as it does other names in the
model, by normalizing case and replacing spaces by underscores. Let's
suppose that the model is <tt><i>/where/ever/</i>Model.uml</tt> and it
contains domains <i>House Management</i> and <i>Digital IO</i> (the
latter containing a child package stereotyped
&#171;domain-interface&#187; called <i>Digital IO Interface</i> with
the tag <tt>{name=Digital IO}</tt>, see <font color="red">XXX</font>):

<pre>
   DOMAINS = House_Management Digital_IO Digital_IO_Interface
</pre>

<p>Tell ColdFrame about the relationship between <tt>Model.uml</tt>
and the domains using the incantation

<pre>
   $(addsuffix .norm,$(DOMAINS)): $(MODELS)/Model.norm-stamp ;
</pre>

<p>Later on, you'll add rules to build the executables, but to start
with you can just generate the code:

<pre>
   all:: $(addsuffix .gen,$(DOMAINS))
</pre>

<h3>Creating your build directories</h3>

<p>If you have a recent GNAT you can use the <tt>-p</tt> flag to
tell <tt>gnatmake</tt> or <tt>gprbuild</tt> to create any needed
directories as required.

<p>If not, assuming you have the environment
variables <tt>COLDFRAME</tt> and <tt>BUILD_BASE</tt> set up, you can
say

<pre>
   <i>$</i> $COLDFRAME/scripts/create-build-directories
</pre>

<h3>Creating
a <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/GNAT-Project-Manager.html">GNAT
Project</a> file</h3>

<p>If you don't need to override any of the <tt>ColdFrame.Project</tt>
source, your project file can be pretty simple: the supplied
<tt>Regressions.gpr</tt> (in the <tt>test/</tt> subdirectory) is

<pre>
   with "Options";
   with "ColdFrame";
   with "bc";
   with "aunit";

   project Regressions is

     for Main use ("<i>regression_tests.adb</i>");

     for Exec_Dir use ".";

     for Source_Dirs use
       (
	"<i>Compilation_Regressions</i>.impl",
	"<i>Compilation_Regressions</i>.gen",
	"<i>Regressions</i>.impl",
	"<i>Regressions</i>.gen"
       );

     for Object_Dir use Options'Object_Dir & "/main";
     package IDE renames Options.IDE;
     package Builder renames Options.Builder;
     package Compiler renames Options.Compiler;
     package Binder renames Options.Binder;
     package Linker renames Options.Linker;

   end Regressions;
</pre>

<p>Add further domains as required, of course.

<h3>Overriding <tt>ColdFrame.Project</tt> source</h3>

<p>If you need to override some of the Ada source code in the
<tt>$COLDFRAME/project</tt> directory, life becomes complicated
because you have to avoid circularity and having multiple occurrences
of the same file; you can't use the supplied
<tt>ColdFrame.gpr</tt>.

<p>Suppose your overriding source is in
<tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject/project</tt>; change directory to
<tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject</tt> and say
<pre>
   $ $COLDFRAME/scripts/install-project
</pre>

<p>This will place those of ColdFrame's files that you haven't
overridden in <tt>~/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject/inherited</tt>.

<p>The project file now looks like

<p><pre>
   with "Options";
   with "bc";
   with "aunit";

   project Regressions is

     for Main use ("<i>regression_tests</i>");

     for Exec_Dir use ".";

     Project_Base = external ("HOME") & "/Base/Build/ColdFrameProject";

     for Source_Dirs use
       (
	"<i>Regressions</i>.impl",
	"<i>Regressions</i>.gen",
	external ("COLDFRAME") & "/lib",
	Project_Base & "/project",
	Project_Base & "/inherited"
       );

     for Object_Dir use Options'Object_Dir & "/main";
     package IDE renames Options.IDE;
     package Builder renames Options.Builder;
     package Compiler renames Options.Compiler;
     package Binder renames Options.Binder;
     package Linker renames Options.Linker;

   end Regressions;
</pre>

<h2>Windows notes</h2>

<p>ColdFrame is built on a Unix system and requires typical Unix
utilities in order to function.

<p>A Unix-like environment which has proved effective in the past
is <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.

<p>When installing Cygwin, choose the 'developer' option.
