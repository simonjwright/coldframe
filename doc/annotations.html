<h1>ColdFrame: Annotations</h1>

<p>ColdFrame originally used its own home-grown <i>annotations</i>
instead of UML <i>tagged values</i> as a means of decorating models
with information to support code generation.

<p>The translation rules are

<p><table border="1">

<tr><th>Annotation <th>Tagged value

<tr><td><center><tt>[[</tt></center> <td><center><tt>{</tt>

<tr><td><center><tt>:</center></tt> <td><center><tt>=</center></tt>

<tr><td><center><tt>,</center></tt> <td><center><tt>|</center></tt>

<tr><td><center><tt>;</center></tt> <td><center><tt>,</center></tt>

<tr><td><center><tt>]]</center></tt> <td><center><tt>}</center></tt>

</table>

<p>so that the old
<pre>
   [[ enumeration : stale, fresh ; callback ]]
</pre>

<p>becomes
<pre>
   { enumeration = stale | fresh, callback }
</pre>

<p>Annotations had to be in a documentation section, whereas tagged
values can be placed anywhere (but it would be a good idea to check
out whether ColdFrame actually does what you expect if you want to put
the tagged value anywhere else; and remember that too much clutter on
a diagram is a Bad Thing).

<p>You could only have one annotation section per documentation
section, but multiple semicolon-separated annotations were allowed;
you can use as many tagged values as you like, so the example above
could equally be written
<pre>
   { enumeration = stale | fresh }
   { callback }
</pre>

<p>ColdFrame used to report all tagged values and unrecognised
annotations. Now, any unrecognised tagged values are included in the
normalized XML as attributes, so that you can add your own
post-processing (for example, special code generation methods).
