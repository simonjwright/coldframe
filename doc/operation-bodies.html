<h1>ColdFrame: Operation Bodies</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Operation declarations are generated in the appropriate package
specification.

<p>Normally, the body is generated as a body stub in the corresponding package body, and

<tt>separate</tt> proper bodies <i>(this is the reason why all the
operations of all but protected types, and all the operations of a
class bar entries, must have distinct names;
see <a href="https://www.adaic.com/standards/95lrm/html/RM-10-1-3.html">ARM
10.1.3</a> (14))</i>.

<p>The proper bodies are compilable, but raise
a <tt>Not_Yet_Implemented</tt> exception if called. They are initially
generated in <tt><i>domain</i>.gen</tt>; move them
to <tt><i>domain</i>.impl</tt>, change the protection to read/write,
and edit as required (remembering to remove the 'Edit this' comment at
the top!)

<p>With some limitations, it's possible instead to specify an
operation's body content in the model. This has the advantage of
reducing the number of implementation files to be kept under
configuration management, and also makes it much simpler to change the
name and profile of an operation.

<h2>"Modelling"</h2>

<p>Given a class with an operation (<tt>Is_Set</tt>) selected,

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-class.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set highlighted">

<br>
<p>the left of the lower panel looks like

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-lpanel-1.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set">

<br>
<p>and the right like

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-rpanel-1.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set, empty Method">

<br>
<p>Click on the arrowhead by <i>Method</i>

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-rpanel-2.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set, clicked Method">

<br>
<p>and click on the text (lower) icon, which brings up a box into
which you can enter the code (this is a very unreal example! more
later ...)

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-rpanel-3.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set, adding text>"

<br>
<p>To save, go to the left of the panel,

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-lpanel-2.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set, save changed method>"

<br>
<p>and click on the left arrowhead by the <i>Specification</i>; the
right of the panel now shows one (unnamed) method, which you can
revisit by double-clicking on it.

<p>
<img
class="screenshot"
src="body-rpanel-4.png"
alt="Class Button. operation Is_Set, method added>"

<pr>
<p>ColdFrame only allows one method. If you accidentally create
another, you can delete it (it will be the bottom one, but do check!)
by selecting it and clicking on the wastebin icon.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<h3>Declarations</h3>

<p>The given body text is inserted into the generated code as-is
(properly indented). You can't add code to the subprogram's
declarative region.

<p>However, you can use a declare block: for the <tt>Is_Set</tt>
function above, this could look like

<pre>
declare
   Set_In_State : constant array (State_Machine_State_T) of Boolean
     := (Pushed | Held | Timed | Pushed_Again => True,
         others => False);
begin
   return Set_In_State (This.State_Machine_State);
end;
</pre>

<p>You'll have to write the code anyway, but you might consider that
that is about at the limit of what's manageable.

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>ColdFrame adds context clauses (<tt>with</tt>s) to the class
package body for all classes related to this class and for
associations in which this class is mentioned.

<p>If you need more, you'll have to implement the operation in a
proper body.
