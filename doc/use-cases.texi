@chapter Introduction

When code is automatically generated from a model (in the present case,
a UML model), there are two approaches:

@table @asis

@item Use a Design Model

A design model is derived from an analysis model by adding support
classes to map the analysis model to the Software Architecture
(@pxref{Software Architecture}). An example would be a container for all
the instances of a given class.

A tool which uses this approach is @uref{http://www.rational.com/,
Rational} Rose.

@item Use an Analysis model

An analysis model contains classes and relationships that are part of
the subject matter of the analyzed subsystem. Code which supports the
execution of the model (for example, navigation from an instance of one
class through an association to find the set of corresponding instances
of another class) is automatically generated.

Tools which use this approach include Software through Pictures from
@uref{http://www.aonix.com/,Aonix}, Rhapsody from I-Logix, iUML from
@uref{http://www.kc.com/,Kennedy-Carter}, BridgePoint from
@uref{http://www.projtech.com/,Project Technology}, and the present
project.

@end table

Automatically-generated support code comes in several flavours:

@table @asis

@item Explicitly-generated

The code generation process writes out new code. An example is the
creation of a record structure to correspond to instance attributes.

@item Instantiation

The new code is an instantiation of an existing generic component.

@item Derivation

The new code is an extension of an existing (base) component.

@end table

This set of Use Cases (well, that's what I'm calling them!) covers the
requirements to be met by the Software Architecture (@pxref{Software
Architecture}), particularly by supporting components.

The Actor concerned is the analyst who specifies the logic of operations
or actions. The programmer who implements these specifications (or, in
an advanced tool such as iUML or BridgePoint, implements the mechanisms
which provide full translation) is, rather, concerned with building
components to meet the requirements expressed here, and (eventually)
with using them.

No distinction is made at this point between generic and base
components.

@node General considerations, Instances, Introduction, Top
@chapter General considerations

It isn't possible to maintain all the invariants of the model (for
example, constraints on relationships) within any given operation; on
the other hand, the analyst must not allow any operation to complete
with the model in an inconsistent state.



@c========================================================================
@node Instances, Associations, General considerations, Top
@chapter Instances

The existence of an Instance must be independent of how many copies of
its data are held. One possibility is to have the Class be responsible
for the existence of Instances.

* Delete an Instance::

@end menu

@node Create an Instance, Delete an Instance, Instances, Instances
@section Create an Instance

When an Instance of a Class is to be created, the analyst specifies a
set of attributes which cover the Class' Identifier
(@pxref{Identifier}).

Once the Instance has been created (with default values for
non-identifier attributes), other attributes are set.

It would be possible to support any legal combination of attributes
(besides the identifying attributes, which must be supplied); this is
likely to be prohibitively complex, unless the implementation language
allows default values for subprogram parameters. An acceptable
alternative strategy would be to require that all the attributes be
supplied at once.


@node Delete an Instance, Access an Instance, Create an Instance, Instances
@section Delete an Instance

The prime way of deleting an Instance is to ask its Class to delete
it. This could either be in terms of the complete Identifier
(@pxref{Identifier}) or by using a valid selected Instance.

An Instance can be asked to delete itself; this will resolve into the
Class operation discussed above.


@node Access an Instance, Select a set of Instances, Delete an Instance, Instances
@section Access an Instance

There are five (any advance on five?) ways of getting a single Instance:

@itemize

@item By creating it.

@item By querying its Class using the identifier (@pxref{Identifier}).

@item During iteration over a set of Instances.

@item By navigating from a single Instance to the ``1'' or ``0..1'' end
of an Association (@pxref{Associations}). Note, the latter can result in
``None'' as a valid answer.

@item By navigating an Inheritance relationship from a single Instance
(@pxref{Inheritance relationships}).

@end itemize

Once the Instance has been accessed, various operations are possible:

@itemize

@item Read the values of attributes.

@item Update the values of non-identifying attributes.

@item Delete the Instance.

@end itemize


@node Select a set of Instances, Operate on a set of Instances, Access an Instance, Instances
@section Select a set of Instances

Some operations (see @pxref{Access an Instance}) result in single
Instances; others result in (possibly empty) sets of Instances. These
include:

@itemize

@item Querying the Class using a non-identifying subset of the
attributes.

@item Navigating from a single Instance to the ``1..n'' or ``0..n'' end
of an Association (@pxref{Associations}).

@item Any navigation from a set of Instances.

@end itemize


@node Operate on a set of Instances,  , Select a set of Instances, Instances
@section Operate on a set of Instances

Given a set of Instances (which includes the set of all the Instances),
the analyst must be able to specify operations on the set.

In some cases these may be predetermined (for example, determine the
number of members of the set).

In other cases the actual operation is analyst-specified. Variations to
consider include:

@itemize

@item Perform a read-only operation on each member: for example, print
all Policies.

@item Update each member: for example, apply increment to terminal bonus.

@item Delete each member: for example, delete expired Policies.

@item Navigate from each member: for example, collect the Policy Holder's
address details.

@end itemize

The above list is expressed as though the operation must apply to each
set member. Clearly this isn't necessarily the case; however, it may
often be cleaner to perform a more rigorous selection first and then
apply the operation to all the members of the result set.



@c========================================================================
@node Associations, Inheritance relationships, Instances, Top
@chapter Associations

In some simple cases it may be possible to implement an association
between instances of two classes (or two instances of the same class)
without introducing a ``third party''. In most cases, though, a third
party class will be necessary.

For example, if it is (or may be) necessary to navigate the association
in either direction, language rules may well prohibit the mutual
visibility that would be necessary (Ada 95 doesn't permit this unless
the ``with type'' feature is implemented).

@menu
* Create an association::
* Delete an association::
* Navigate an association::
@end menu

@node Create an association, Delete an association, Associations, Associations
@section Create an association

Given two distinct instances (is that true? is it possible for an
instance to be associated with itself?), the analyst can require that
they be linked via an association. In some cases (eg, unconditional
associations), instances must be associated. Ideally some form of model
integrity check should be supported. This should include checks that no
extant association involving either instance already exists.

Normally it will be obvious which end is which; this won't be so for
reflexive associations. It must be possible to specify which is which:
the role names (phrases) may prove useful.

The Software Architecture (@pxref{Software Architecture}) may support
handles, in which case this operation may be expressed in terms of
handles; if not, it will have to be in terms of Identifiers.

@node Delete an association, Navigate an association, Create an association, Associations
@section Delete an association

Deleting an association between two Instances may require that one or
both of the Instances be deleted, to maintain model integrity; this is
left to the Analyst.

The Software Architecture (@pxref{Software Architecture}) may support
handles, in which case this operation may be expressed in terms of
handles; if not, it will have to be in terms of Identifiers.

@node Navigate an association,  , Delete an association, Associations
@section Navigate an association

Given an Instance or set of Instances, it must be possible to obtain the
Instance or set of Instances linked via a particular Association.

There is no special support required for chained navigations.

If an association is conditional, it is necessary to support the concept
of a null result (or empty result set).

If an association is unconditional, a null result (or empty result set)
indicates a failure of model integrity and should be unambiguously
reported as such. The reporting mechanism must be controllable.


@c========================================================================
@node Inheritance relationships, Glossary, Associations, Top
@chapter Inheritance relationships

Following the Shlaer-Mellor rules, all parent classes in inheritance
relationships are, in a sense, abstract: whenever an instance of the
parent class exists, there exists precisely one related instance of one
of the child classes.

@menu

@end menu

@node Create an inheritance, Delete an inheritance, Inheritance relationships, Inheritance relationships
@section Create an inheritance

Given a new instance each of parent and child classes, the analyst must
require that they be linked via an inheritance relationship. Ideally
some form of model integrity check should be supported. This should
include checks that no extant relationship involving either instance
already exists.

The Software Architecture (@pxref{Software Architecture}) may support
handles, in which case this operation may be expressed in terms of
handles; if not, it will have to be in terms of Identifiers. Note that
the Identifier of the child class is very likely to be identical to that
of the parent.

@node Delete an inheritance, Migrate an inheritance, Create an inheritance, Inheritance relationships
@section Delete an inheritance

Deleting an inheritance relationship between two Instances requires that
both of the Instances be deleted, to maintain model integrity; this is
left to the Analyst.

The Software Architecture (@pxref{Software Architecture}) may support
handles, in which case this operation may be expressed in terms of
handles; if not, it will have to be in terms of Identifiers.

@node Migrate an inheritance, Navigate an inheritance, Delete an inheritance, Inheritance relationships
@section Migrate an inheritance

Migrating an inheritance relationship between two Instances requires
that the old child Instance be deleted, to maintain model integrity;
this is left to the Analyst.

The Software Architecture (@pxref{Software Architecture}) may support
handles, in which case this operation may be expressed in terms of
handles; if not, it will have to be in terms of Identifiers.

@node Navigate an inheritance,  , Migrate an inheritance, Inheritance relationships
@section Navigate an inheritance

Given a parent Instance, it must be possible to navigate to the child,
and vice versa.

A null result indicates a failure of model integrity and should be
unambiguously reported as such. The reporting mechanism must be
controllable.

@node Glossary,  , Inheritance relationships, Top
@chapter Glossary

@menu

* Software Architecture::
@end menu

@node Identifier, Software Architecture, Glossary, Glossary
@section Identifier

Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some attribute or
combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise Disk might be
identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start
Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start Date then become
``identifying attributes'', whereas Date Of Issue and Period Of Validity
are just common-or-garden attributes. A different analyst might make a
different choice (Serial Number, for example) governed often by
practical considerations such as whether they already exist.

@node Software Architecture,  , Identifier, Glossary
@section Software Architecture

The Software Architecture, as considered here, has several components,
but basically it comes down to how the analyst's model is implemented:

@itemize

@item The rules and policies which determine how analytical constructs
such as Classes and Associations are mapped to code.

@item The supporting components (typically generic) which provide the
mechanisms to support the translated code.

@item The language and operating system mechanisms which underpin the
whole.
