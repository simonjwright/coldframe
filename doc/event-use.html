<h2><a name="eventqueues">Event queues</a></h2>

<p>All code is executed in the context of some Ada task. There are
three relevant kinds of task:

<ul>

<li>the environment task (the main program),

<li>the task associated with an instance of an &#171;active&#187; class,

<li>the <i>dispatcher</i> task associated with an event queue,

</ul>

<p>and you must make sure that a domain's data is manipulated in a way
that's safe from concurrent access by more than one of these tasks.

<p>A common pattern, which might be called <em>"access domain data
from domain events"</em>, is shown in the sequence diagram below. In
it, the only task which accesses a domain's data is the
<i>dispatcher</i> task associated with its event queue.

<p><img src="house-management-operation.png">

<p>All code in the discussion below is from the House Management
domain in the <tt>examples/</tt> subdirectory of the distribution.

<p><em>Operation 1</em> occurs in the Digital IO domain, in the
context of Digital IO's event queue.

<p><em>Operation 1.1</em> is the callback of the registered operation
<tt>Button.Changed</tt>, still in Digital IO's context. This creates a
new <tt>Button Event</tt>, whose payload is the pushed button's name
(<em>Operation 1.1.1</em>), and posts it onto House Management's event
queue (<em>Operation 1.1.2</em>):
<pre>
   declare
      E : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
	:= new Button_Event;
      P : Button_Name renames Button_Event (E.all).Payload;
   begin
      P := Buttons (S.S);
      ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (E, On => Events.Dispatcher);
   end;
</pre>

<p><em>Operation 2</em> represents the firing of the <tt>Button
Event</tt> when it reaches the head of the House Management event
queue, in the House Management context. The generated <tt>Handler</tt>
calls the &#171;handler&#187; operation <tt>Button.Pushed</tt>
(<em>Operation 2.1</em>), which, instead of posting another event,
creates a <tt>Button Push</tt> event for the Lamp concerned
(<em>Operation 2.1.1</em>) on the stack and then invokes its generated
<tt>Handler</tt> (<em>Operation 2.1.2</em>):
<pre>
   <a name="synchronous">procedure Button_Pushed</a> (L : Lamp.Handle) is
      Ev : Lamp.Button_Push (For_The_Instance => L);
   begin
      Lamp.Handler (Ev);
   end Button_Pushed;
</pre>

<p>The generated body of <tt>Lamp.Handler</tt> includes the code
<pre>
   case This.State_Machine_State is
      when Idle =>
	 This.Old_State_Machine_State := Idle;
	 This.State_Machine_State := Lit;
	 Turn_On (This);
	 Set_Timeout (This);
</pre>

<p>which corresponds to <em>Operation 2.1.2.1</em> and <em>Operation
2.1.2.2</em> and completes the processing.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>This style of event processing, which could be called
<i>synchronous</i>, is subject to one limitation: if an action needs
to create an event <em>on the same instance of the same class</em>,
the event must only be processed synchronously if

<ul>

<li> the action is the last in the state,

<li> the synchronous processing is the last thing done by the action,
and

<li> there isn't a completion transition from the state.

</ul>

<p>Otherwise, the event <i>must</i> be posted rather than being processed
synchronously.

<p>Class event handlers can always process events synchronously.

<p>There's no logical difference between the synchronous and posting
styles; posting is more consistent, while synchronous is more
efficient (it saves a memory allocation/freeing and a couple of
context switches, perhaps 20 to 30 microseconds on a 1 GHz PowerPC
under VxWorks).


<h2><a name="eventpriorities">Event priorities</a></h2>

<p>There are effectively four priority levels for events on any given
event queue: from the lowest to the highest,

<ol>
<li>Class events,
<li>Instance events,
<li>Self events (instance events posted using <tt>Post_To_Self</tt>),
<li>Synchronous events (events declared on the stack and handled
immediately).
</ol>

<p>The priority affects which event is chosen to be processed
next. Once chosen, events run to completion.

<p><b>Class events</b> are to be used for transferring information
into domains and possibly from a task in the domain to the rest of the
domain (this may not be necessary). They should <em>not</em> be used
within the domain; once inside, subprogram calls and instance events
are the way to go.

<p><b>Instance events</b> control state machines.

<p><b>Self events</b> are instance events used where you don't want to
leave the state until some condition is reached. If you are waiting
for two resources to become available, you could have the arrival of a
resource signalled by an event, and post a self event when you have
enough:

<p><img src="self-events.png">

<p>Note that the reason for posting a self event is that it really
denotes completion of the original action: you want it to be
processed <em>before</em> any further instance events.

<p><b>Synchronous events</b> are handled in the context of the
caller. If called from a class event, there are no specific
considerations; if from an instance event and the synchronous event is
for 'self', make sure that the synchronous event handling is the last
thing that is done (once the synchronous event has been handled, the
state machine involved will have moved on).


<h2><a name="postinganevent">Posting an event</a></h2>

<p>The typical code for posting an event <tt>Ev</tt> is
<pre>
   ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (Ev, On => Events.Dispatcher);
</pre>

<p>Clearly <tt>Ev</tt> has to be created. If it's a class event of
type <tt>Wait</tt> to class <i>Class</i>, this would be
<pre>
   Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
     := new Class.Wait;
</pre>

<p>whereas if it's an instance event, and we have a handle <tt>H</tt>,
it would be
<pre>
   Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
     := new Class.Done (H);
</pre>

<p>If you need to set the payload, add a renaming:
<pre>
   Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
     := new Class.Info;
   Payload : Message renames Class.Info (Ev.all).Payload;
</pre>

<p>where
<ul>

<li><tt>Ev.all</tt> is of type
<tt>ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_Base'Class</tt>,

<li><tt>Class.Info (Ev.all)</tt> is a view conversion to
<tt>Class.Info</tt>,

<li>after which you can set up the payload before

<li>posting the event.

</ul>

<p>In total,
<pre>
   declare
      Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
        := new Class.Info;
      Payload : Message renames Class.Info (Ev.all).Payload;
   begin
      Payload := Some_Value;
      ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (Ev, On => Events.Dispatcher);
   end;
</pre>

<p>... or you might prefer
<pre>
   declare
      Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
        := new Class.Info;
   begin
      Class.Info (Ev.all).Payload := Some_Value;
      ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (Ev, On => Events.Dispatcher);
   end;
</pre>

<p>Of course, if you don't need a payload, it's much simpler:
<pre>
   ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (new Class.Done (H),
                                  On => Events.Dispatcher);
</pre>


<h2><a name="locking">Locking</a></h2>

<p>An earlier version of the <a
href="event-modelling.html#example-model">example state model</a> was

<p><img src="lamp-state-resetting.png">

<p>If the task executing <a
href="event-translation.html#is_on"><tt>Is_On</tt></a> isn't the same
one as that executing the state machine, there is a possibility that
<tt>Is_On</tt> may catch the instance in an intermediate state (in
this case, the state <tt>Resetting</tt>). There are two approaches to
this problem.

<p>In the simpler, it's clear that <tt>Resetting</tt> is an
intermediate state; the state machine bounces immediately back to
<tt>On</tt> via a completion transition, so <tt>Is_On</tt> could be
coded
<pre>
   function Is_On (This : Handle) return Boolean is
   begin
      return This.State_Machine_State = On
               or else This.State_Machine_State = Resetting;
   end Is_On;
</pre>

<p>If the simple approach isn't good enough, it's possible to
<i>lock</i> the domain's event queue:
<pre>
   function Is_On (This : Handle) return Boolean is
      L : ColdFrame.Project.Events.Lock (Events.Dispatcher);
      pragma Warnings (Off, L);
   begin
      return This.State_Machine_State = On;
   end Is_On;
</pre>

<p>After the <tt>Lock</tt> <tt>L</tt> has been elaborated,
ColdFrame guarantees that

<ul>

<li>there are no outstanding self events on <tt>Dispatcher</tt>

<li>no further events will be dispatched by <tt>Dispatcher</tt> until
<tt>L</tt> is destroyed (by going out of scope).

</ul>

<p>Note that there's no guarantee about the relative timing of events
and locks; you could post an event and then take a lock, but the event
may or may not have been handled when the lock is achieved.

<h2><a name="activeclasses">Active classes</a></h2>

<p>There's no reason why an active class can't have a state machine as
well, though you have to be careful about concurrent access to
instance variables (use <i>{volatile}</i>
or <i>{atomic}</i>; <tt>State_Machine_State</tt> is automatically made
atomic if the class is active) and about
initialization, <a href="initialization.html#singleton">especially
of <i>&#171;singleton&#187;</i>s</a>.

<p>This idiom can be very useful to deal with interrupt handling. See
<i>Interrupt_Handling</i> in the <tt>example/</tt> subdirectory of
the distribution.
