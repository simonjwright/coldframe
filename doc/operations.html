<h1>ColdFrame: Operations</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The purpose of operations is to implement the actual functionality
of the domain.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>Operations are used

<ul>

<li><a href="#basic">to provide basic functionality</a>,

<li><a href="#accessor">to provide access to instance and class variables</a>,

<li><a href="#init">to provide initialization (of the domain)</a>,

<li><a href="#final">to support finalization (of instances)</a>,

<li><a href="#unit">to support unit test</a>,

<li><a href="#statemachines">to support state machines</a>,

<li><a href="event-modelling.html#class-event-handlers">to process
class (non-state machine) events</a>,

<li><a href="callbacks.html">to process callbacks from other
domains</a>,

<li><a href="types.html#access-to-operation">to define
access-to-subprogram types</a>,

<li><a href="#entry">to define task or protected type entries</a>,

</ul>

<p>You can specify the <a href="#convention">programming language
convention</a> to be used.

<p><a href="#renaming">Renamings</a> are provided to allow a form of
overloading.

<h3><a name="basic">Basic functionality</a></h3>

<p>For classes, you must only have one operation with a given name,
except for <a href="#entry">&#171;entry&#187;</a>s
and <a href="#renaming">&#171;renaming&#187;</a>s. It's allowed to
have operations with the same name as generated subprograms
(<tt><a href="classes.html#create">Create</a></tt>, <tt>Find</tt>
and <tt>Delete</tt>), but you do need to ensure that the parameter
profiles don't clash.

<p>You can't overload operations of types at all.

<p><a name="class-operations">Class operations</a> (no <tt>This</tt>
parameter will be generated) are marked by checking
the <i>ownerScope</i> checkbox in the <i>modifiers</i> section of the
ArgoUML <i>Properties</i> tab.

<p>Dispatching operations (which must be instance operations) are
marked by checking the <i>isAbstract</i> checkbox in
the <i>modifiers</i> section of the ArgoUML <i>Properties</i> tab. The
operation will be implemented in a child class.

<h3><a name="accessor">Accessors</a></h3>

<p>Instance and class variables are private, regardless of what you
say in the model. You can create accessor operations and
you can mark them <em>&#171;accessor&#187;</em>.

<p>For an attribute <tt><i>Attr</i></tt>, an operation is a "set"
accessor if it is a procedure named <tt>Set_<i>Attr</i></tt> with a
single parameter of the same type as <tt><i>Attr</i></tt>, and an
operation is a "get" accessor if it is a function named
<tt>Get_<i>Attr</i></tt> with no parameters returning a value of the
same type as <tt><i>Attr</i></tt>.

<p>The "class-ness" of the attribute and the operation must match.

<h3><a name="init">Domain initialization</a></h3>

<p>Operations to be called from the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>
procedure are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em> and will be treated as
a <a href="#class-operations">class operations</a>. These operations
must be parameterless procedures.

<h3><a name="final">Finalization of instances</a></h3>

<p>Operations to be called to clean up as an instance is deleted (for
example, to tidy up associations) are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;finalize&#187;</em>. (It would be possible in theory to use
Ada's controlled types, but that depends on your target language being
Ada). Also, it's possible to have more than one &#171;finalize&#187;
operation.

<h3><a name="unit">Unit test support</a></h3>

<p>Instance operations to be called during teardown (in unit test) are
marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;teardown&#187;</em>. It's
possible to have more than one &#171;teardown&#187; operation; they'll
be called in alphabetical order. These are intended to clean up
resources such as file descriptors; don't try to tidy up associations,
they're in an indeterminate state during teardown.

<p>&#171;finalize&#187; operations can call &#171;teardown&#187;s,
but &#171;teardown&#187; operations should <em>not</em> call
&#171;finalize&#187; ones.

<h3><a name="statemachines">State machines</a></h3>

<p>Usually, an operation used as a state machine action mustn't delete
the instance. The <tt>Delete</tt> operation is specially recognised;
if you need to make one of your own operations delete the instance,
you must stereotype it &#171;final&#187;.

<p>A &#171;final&#187; operation should <em>always</em> delete the
instance.

<h3><a name="entry">Entries</a></h3>

<h4><a name="task-entry">Task entries</a></h4>

<p>In an <i>active</i> class, you can specify task entries using the
<em>&#171;entry&#187;</em> stereotype. It's permissible to have an
ordinary operation with the same name as an &#171;entry&#187;, because
&#171;entry&#187; operations don't generate normal subprograms.

<h4><a name="protected-type-entry">Protected type entries</a></h4>

<p>In a &#171;protected&#187; type, you can nominate procedures
(operations without a return value) as entries using the
<em>&#171;entry&#187;</em> stereotype.

<p>The point about an entry of a <a
href="http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-9-4.html">protected
type</a> is that your implementation specifies a guard condition;
callers of the entry block until the guard becomes open.

<h3><a name="convention"></a>Convention</h3>

<p>You can use the <em>&#171;convention&#187;</em> stereotype with
the <tt>{language = <i>language</i>}</tt> tag to specify the
programming language to be used..

<h3><a name="renaming">Renaming</a></h3>

<p>You can use the <em>&#171;renaming&#187;</em> stereotype with
the <tt>{renames=<i>other-operation</i>}</tt> tag to specify a form of
overloading (ColdFrame's translation approach rules out actual
overloading). Ada semantics apply (for example, you can change
parameter defaults).

<h2>Translation</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Operations stereotyped <em>&#171;convention&#187;</em> and tagged
with a language (<i>C</i>, probably) will have
<pre>
pragma Convention (<i>operation</i>, <i>language</i>);
</pre>

<p><a href="#task-entry">Task entries</a> map to <tt>entry</tt>
specifications in the class's task specification.

<p>Operations and <a href="#protected-type-entry">entries</a> of
protected types map to operations and entries in the type
specification (in the domain package specification) and in the type's
separate proper body.

<p><a href="#accessor">Accessors</a> map to declarations in the class
package specification. If marked <em>&#171;accessor&#187;</em>, proper
bodies are generated in the class package body; if not, body stubs are
generated in the package body with <tt>separate</tt> proper bodies,
like other operations except that you have the opportunity to provide
your own implementation if desired.

<p>Other operations are generated as

<ul>

<li>declarations in the appropriate package specification,

<li>body stubs in the corresponding package body, and

<li><tt>separate</tt> proper bodies <i>(this is the reason why all the
operations of all but protected types, and all the operations of a
class bar entries, must have distinct names;
see <a href="http://www.adaic.com/standards/95lrm/html/RM-10-1-3.html">ARM
10.1.3</a> (14))</i>.<br>

The bodies are compilable, but raise a <tt>Not_Yet_Implemented</tt>
exception if called.

</ul>

<p>Operations with returns (<i>op():type-name</i> in the model) are
implemented as functions.

<h3>The <tt>this</tt> parameter</h3>

<p>A parameter <tt>This : Handle;</tt> is automatically generated for
non-class, non-<em>&#171;entry&#187;</em> operations
of <a href="classes.html#modelling">normal</a> classes.

<p>See <a href="operation-parameters.html">separate notes</a> on
analyst-specified parameters.
