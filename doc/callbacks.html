<h1>ColdFrame: Callbacks</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Many systems use the Layered approach to architecture, and it's
likely that a ColdFrame-based system will do the same. In any case,
there has to be support for interactions between different Domains
(subject matters).

<p>To avoid awkward dependencies, both at the design level and in the
translated code, ColdFrame supports <i>callbacks</i>. Another name for
this concept is the <i>Observer</i> pattern.

<p>With callbacks, the lower-level domain provides a facility so that
higher-level domains can <i>register</i> to be informed when a
particular event occurs; when it does occur, the lower-level domain
<i>calls the callbacks</i>, which notifies the registered higher-level
domains (clients) without needing to know anything about them.

<p>A domain can <i>deregister</i> from a callback, though it would be
more normal to connect at initialization and stay connected.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<h3>Server-side</h3>

<p>In the lower-level domain, create a type corresponding to the event
that clients need notifying about.

<p>Mark it as a callback type by applying
the <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em> stereotype.

<p>If the data you want to transmit is a basic type (such
as <i>Boolean</i>), you'll still need to create a domain type to
apply <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em> to. This could be via
a <a href="types.html#renaming">renaming</a>.

<h3>Client-side</h3>

<p>First, import the callback type from the server domain (the
stereotype <em>&#171;imported&#187;</em> and the
tag <tt>{imported=<i>Server</i>}</tt>).

<p>In an appropriate class, create an operation taking a single
(<tt>in</tt>) parameter of the imported callback type, to act as the
receiver.

<p>ColdFrame provides automatic registration for such an operation
with the server if you apply the
stereotype <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em>; in that case the operation
will be treated as a class operation. If you don't want this (that is,
you'll register with the server callback "by hand"), you <em>must</em>
model the operation as a class operation (by
checking <i>ownerScope</i>).

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>For a <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em> type <i>CB</i>, ColdFrame
generates an instantiation:
<pre>
   package <i>Domain</i>.CB_Callback
   is new ColdFrame.Callbacks
     (T => <i>Domain</i>.CB);
</pre>

<p>For a <em>&#171;callback&#187;</em> operation, ColdFrame generates
the code necessary to move the callback message from the server
domain's context to the client domain's context, using implicit class
events. When the callback operation is invoked, it is in the client
domain's context and can use synchronous event processing as
appropriate.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p><a href="event-use.html">Here's an example of mixing callbacks and
events</a>.

<p>If all you want to say is that something has happened, mark your
&#171;callback&#187; datatype <em>&#171;null&#187;</em> . ColdFrame
generates a <tt>null record</tt> declaration. To create an instance of
a null record (to call the callbacks with), say <tt>(null&nbsp;record)</tt>.

<p>Don't bother to deregister for callbacks during AUnit test
teardown; ColdFrame automatically does this for you.
