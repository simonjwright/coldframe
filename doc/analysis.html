<h1>ColdFrame: Analysis</h1>

<p>People often think that the right place to start an analysis is in
front of a computer running a UML modelling tool. This approach is
tempting but wrong, for several reasons.

<h2>Requirements and design</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to work out what the problem domain is and
what the constraints (performance, safety, security, environment,
legal etc) are. In an older (some would say, more mature) way of doing
things, this would have been an appropriate time to produce
an <a
href="http://www.pushface.org/mil_498/srs-did.htm#scope">SRS</a>
and
an <a
href="http://www.pushface.org/mil_498/sdd-did.htm#scope">SDD</a>. In
the UML world, this need is possibly best met by using Use Cases or at
least user stories, with at least two intended audiences:

<ul>

<li>The person, architect or systems engineer, who has to sign off on
the proposed development and (later) remember how it fits into the
greater scheme; and

<li>The person who has to develop and (later) maintain the model.

</ul>

<p>However, remember that Use Cases only make up about 30% of a
typical requirement statement.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Even when the requirements are clear, it's still not time to start
drawing UML models on the computer. It usually takes several
iterations before you have a model that begins to reflect the problem
domain, and it's much cheaper to sketch it out, in pencil or (not so
good) on a whiteboard. Modelling in a tool offers far too much
opportunity to waste time by making a bad model look good, and also
gives a spurious air of correctness which a pencil sketch in your
notebook doesn't. Make notes! Especially, make notes on why a
particular design
<em>didn't</em> work! You might find that a Wiki- or blog-based
approach works for this phase, provided it's acceptable in your
workplace.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The modeller's job is to understand, and make clear to the reader,
what each entity in the model means and why it is there. This will
mean writing clear descriptions of the classes, the attributes, the
associations and the roles.

Unfortunately, documentation in the model probably won't be enough.
The model is essentially flat, and the reader needs some guidance on
how things fit together; some sort of roadmap. Internal use cases,
possibly expressed in sequence diagrams, may help here, but it's a bad
idea to insist on too high a level of detail too soon (for example,
insisting on defining operations rather than messages).

<h2>Good models</h2>

<p>High-level languages such as Ada and C++ show the benefits of
strong typing; it makes it easier to write code that 'does the right
thing', if done properly, because it constrains the code that can be
written so that many mistakes can be caught by compilers.

<p>A crisp UML model offers similar benefits.

<p>A good model is like a scientific hypothesis: it should be possible
for it to be proved wrong. I could say that the identifier
of <i>Car</i> was its licence plate number, which would be a
reasonable first stab in the UK; but it turns out that you can swap
licence plate numbers if you pay enough. Perhaps a Vehicle Index
Number would do? well, yes, provided you don't care about cars made
before VINs were invented. And not many people know their car's
VIN. Our problem domain may allow the licence plate number after all;
if you're running a car fleet you're not going to be changing the
numberplates! (unless you have a limo and bought a special plate for
it. I think <i>A1</i> is taken but you get the idea ...)

<p>Vagueness is a bad thing in a model. If your project is a
van-rental business, your customers borrow vans. At any time, each
customer is borrowing zero or more vans.

<p>What about the vans?  Clearly a van can only be on loan to one
customer at a time; on the other hand, it may not be on loan at
all. So we could try this ...

<p><img src="vague-association.png">

<p>... which is true but perhaps not as true as it could be. For
example, if the van's on loan, we want to know when the loan
terminates. This could be held in a <i>Van</i>
attribute <i>loan termination</i> of type <i>Date</i>.

<p>But what happens when the van isn't on loan? Now <i>loan
termination</i> is meaningless. We could use an association class ...

<p><img src="better-association.png">

<p>... which gives us a logical place for a <i>termination</i>
attribute. Note that although you must (in ColdFrame) have an
association class for a many-to-many association, there's nothing to
stop you having one for other kinds of association if that models the
problem better.

<p>Having the <i>Loan</i> class gives a place for a state model for
the loan. It's likely to be fairly simple, unless there are
complicated business rules about late loans and escalation -- but in
that case you might be better off separating those concerns into
another domain.

<p>There's still a possible issue to be explored. The vans will need
servicing, but clearly they can't be serviced if they're out with a
customer. One way of dealing this is to use a specialization
relationship ...

<p><img src="inheritance.png">

<p>... which retains the previous ability to have a <i>termination</i>
attribute without any doubt as to whether it means anything at the
moment and to have a state model for the loan (now on <i>Hired
Van</i>). In addition, only <i>Pool Van</i>s can be sent off to be
serviced.

<p>This is of course more complicated; whether it's worth the trouble
or not will depend on how complicated the application rules are.
