<h1>ColdFrame: Event translation</h1>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Each event is mapped to a distinct type, derived from
<tt>ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_Base</tt>, in the package for the
class to which the event is directed. Instance events are derived from
<tt>Instance_Event_Base</tt>, a child of <tt>Event_Base</tt> which is
constrained by an access to the instance to which the event is
directed.

<p>For a class event, this results in
<pre>
   type Button_Event
   is new ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_Base with record
      Payload : Button_Name;
   end record;
</pre>

<p>(all class events have payloads), and for an instance event, in
<pre>
   type Button_Push (For_The_Instance : access Instance)
   is new ColdFrame.Project.Events.Instance_Event_Base (For_The_Instance)
   with null record;
</pre>

<h2>States</h2>

<p>The states in the state model are translated as a private
enumeration type, <tt>State_Machine_State_T</tt>. The initial state
(by default <tt>Initial</tt>) is the first literal.

<p><a href="event-modelling.html#example-model">In the example</a>,
the type would be
<pre>
   type State_Machine_State_T is
     (Initial,
      Idle,
      Lit);
</pre>

<p>The instance state is represented by a created instance variable
<pre>
   State_Machine_State : State_Machine_State_T := Initial;
</pre>

<p>This is not intended to be made directly visible outside the
class. Instead, it's expected that you'll test it within operations
and return an appropriate result:
<pre>
   function <a name="is_on">Is_On</a> (This : Handle) return Boolean is
   begin
      return This.State_Machine_State = Lit;
   end Is_On;
</pre>

<p>Another instance variable <tt>Old_State_Machine_State</tt> is
available if you really need an action to know which state the
instance was in before the event. It's normally better to use
different states.

<h2>Transitions</h2>

<p>When an event is dispatched to a state machine, there are three
possible outcomes, depending on what the state model says about the
event occurring in the current state:

<ul>

<li>If the transition is marked <em>&#171;ignore&#187;</em>, the
event is thrown away.

<li>If the transition isn't in the model, the exception
<tt>ColdFrame.Exceptions.Cant_Happen</tt> is raised.

<li>Otherwise, it's a legal transition:

<ol>

<li>The instance variable <tt>Old_State_Machine_State</tt> is set to the
current state;

<li>the instance variable <tt>State_Machine_State</tt> is set to the
target state;

<li>the transition action and the entry actions are executed in order.

</ol>

so you can write your action operation to behave differently according
to what state you're now in (or have come from, or both). Please
<b>don't</b> alter these variables yourself.

<br>In general, it's better to show behaviour in the state machine
rather than embedded in code.

</ul>

<p>It is legal to use the instance <tt>Delete</tt> operation as an
entry action (ColdFrame doesn't check that it's in a <i>final</i>
state). Of course, it needs to be the <em>last</em> action.
