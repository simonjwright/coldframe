<h1>ColdFrame: Domains</h1>

<p>Definition: a <i>domain</i> is a separate real, hypothetical, or
abstract world inhabited by a distinct set of classes that behave
according to rules and policies characteristic of that domain.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h3>Separation of concerns</h3>

<p>The main reason for using domains is that it simplifies the
analyst's job. It's hard enough to think about one subject matter at a
time, without mixing them up.

<p>A prime example is input/output; if you're considering the rules of
engagement for a weapon system, you really don't want to be worrying
about how the data gets into and out of the system.

<h3>Separation of activity</h3>

<p>Most CASE tools are pretty bad at allowing more than one person to
access the model at once. If you can arrange that a group of classes
and relationships can be treated as a group, by minimising the
interactions with other groups of classes as far as possible, you
stand a better chance of getting the tool to do what you need.

<h3>Software management</h3>

<p>Another reason is to provide sensible work packages!

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>Given the above, the obvious way to model domains is as packages in
the logical model, stereotyped <em>&#171;domain&#187;</em>.

<p>Domain packages can have child packages. This might be to make the
model structure clearer (for example, by separating off all the type
definitions). Alternatively, they might contain model statements that
aren't intended to be translated; such child packages can be
stereotyped <em>&#171;ignore&#187;</em> (to be honest, any package in
the model which is stereotyped <em>&#171;ignore&#187;</em> will be
ignored, as will all its children, recursively).

<h3><a name="tags">Tagged values</a></h3>

<p><tt>init = <i>package.operation</i></tt> specifies an operation to be
called before any other domain initialization.

<p><tt>name = <i>package name</i></tt> specifies the actual package name.

<p><tt>revision = <i>revision-id-string</i></tt> specifies the
domain's version control ID.

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p><a href="testing.html#separating">For testing purposes</a>, it may
be convenient to gather the &#171;public&#187; classes and public
types of a domain into a child package
stereotyped <em>&#171;domain-interface&#187;</em>. The package name
should be <tt><i>Domain</i> Interface</tt>, which controls where the
generated code is placed, and the tagged
value <tt>name=<i>Domain</i></tt> set so that the Ada package names
match those of the actual software.

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>A domain is translated as a top-level Ada package, with the name
derived from the package name using the usual name conversion rules
(it can be overridden using the <tt>{name=<i>new-name</i>}</tt> tag).

<p>Child UML packages are included (recursively). The child UML
package structure is <em>not</em> reflected in the generated code (for
example, all classes end up as direct Ada child packages of the domain
package).

<p>Domain <a href="types.html">types</a> are implemented in the domain
package. For string types, a string hash function is generated as a
child subprogram of the domain package.

<p>Domain <a href="classes.html">classes</a> are implemented as
children of the domain package.

<p>Six further children are generated as standard:

<dl>

<dt><tt><i>Domain</i>.Events</tt>
<dd>Provides <a href="events.html">Event</a> queueing and dispatching.

<dt><a name="initialize"><tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</a></tt>
<dd>Takes an Event Queue parameter, defaulting to <tt>null</tt>.
<br>Initializes the domain by

<ol>

<li>initializing the domain's Event Queue with the supplied Event
Queue, or (if it's <tt>null</tt>) by calling
<tt>Events.Initialize</tt>,

<li>calling the domain initialization operation, if one was specified
by <i>{ init = package.operation }</i>,

<li>initializing all class attributes and singletons via
<tt><i>Class</i>.CF_Class_Initialize</tt>,

<li>and then calling all the
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em> operations of all the classes.

</ol>

<p>The calls are in alphabetical order by class and then by operation.

<p>See also <a href="initialization.html">further discussion</a>.

<dt><a name="teardown"><tt><i>Domain</i>.Tear_Down</a></tt>
<dd>For <a href="testing.html">testing</a> purposes; returns
the domain to its initial state by
<ol>

<li>calling <tt><i>Domain</i>.Events.Tear_Down</tt>, which stops the
domain's Event Queue and deletes it if this was the last reference,

<li>deleting all the class instances and associations.

</ol>

<dt><tt><a name="cascade-initialize"><i>Domain</i>.Cascade_Initialize</tt></a>
<dd>If you need the services of a domain, you have (of course) to
include all the domains that it uses in the build process, At run
time, these domains need to be initialized. The idea behind
<tt>Cascade_Initialize</tt> is to make this process easier, especially
for domain-level testing, and more especially where you are using
"real" versions of the domains you depend on rather than <a
href="testing.html#generating-stub">stubbed</a> ones.
<br>It takes an Event Queue parameter, defaulting to
<tt>null</tt>. The generated code merely calls <tt>Initialize</tt>
with the supplied Event Queue.
<br>To use it as intended, modify it to

<ol>

<li>call <tt>Cascade_Initialize</tt> for all called
domains, <span class="highlight">with the supplied Event Queue</span>,

<li>call its own <tt>Initialize</tt>, <span class="highlight">with the
supplied Event Queue</span>,

<li>and then call <tt>Cascade_Initialize</tt> for any domains known to
require this one (eg, device bottom halves),
again <span class="highlight">with the supplied Event Queue</span>.

</ol>

If you are testing against <a
href="testing.html#generating-stub">stubbed</a> domains, or you're
building a real program, you'll be better off <i>not</i> using
<tt>Cascade_Initialize</tt>; instead, initialize all the used domains
in an appropriate order.

<dt><a name="cascade-teardown"><tt><i>Domain</i>.Cascade_Tear_Down</a></tt>
<dd>The inverse of <tt>Cascade_Initialize</tt>.

<dt><tt><i>Domain</i>.Serializable</tt>
<dd>Provides support for transferring data, both via network
connections and also to files.

</dl>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Each domain must be initialized by calling the procedure
<tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</tt>, probably from your main
program. Because it's a child unit, it must be <tt>with</tt>ed
explicitly.

<p>If you're building your application, rather than unit tests, you'll
probably want to pass <tt><i>Domain</i>.Initialize</tt> the Event
Queue that <tt><i>Domain</i></tt> is to use.

<p>Because all the packages in a domain are implemented as children,
you hardly ever need to mention the domain package when referencing
other packages (you do need to mention the domain in the context
clauses, though):

<pre>
   <b>with <i>Domain.Other_Class</i>;</b>
   separate (<i>Domain.Class</i>)
   procedure Foo
   is
   begin
      <b><i>Other_Class</i></b>.Bar;
      ...
</pre>
