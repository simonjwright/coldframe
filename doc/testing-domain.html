<h1>ColdFrame: Testing Domains</h1>

<p>To set the scene, the Ada software under test (SUT) forms part of a
system. Generally, the system will be constructed using a layered
approach, and the other parts of the system that interact with the SUT
are higher-level (which can call interface subprograms presented by
the SUT) or lower-level (whose interfaces can be called by the SUT, or
which can provide callbacks to the SUT).

<p>ColdFrame supports testing at a level between unit testing (using,
for
example, <a href="http://libre.adacore.com/tools/aunit/">AUnit</a>)
and integration testing (using real hardware). Using a framework
intended for unit testing at this level tends to be fragile, requiring
a lot of rework for even minor functional changes in the requirements.

<p>The
project <a href="http://coldframe.sourceforge.net/scripted_testing">Scripted
Testing</a> provides a framework for testing using a scripting
language. The idea is to build a program including the SUT
and <a href="stubs.html">stubbed versions</a> of the lower-level
domains that it uses; the program adds commands to the scripting
language to interact with the stubbed versions.

<p>This scheme is related to the use
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock
objects</a>.

<p>The scripting language supported
is <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tcl</a>, and specifically the Ada
binding <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcladashell/">TclAdaShell</a>. The
reason for choosing Tcl rather than Python or Lua is that Tcl's
interface is entirely string-based; this is important, considering the
need to specifiy values of enumerated types.

<p>The ColdFrame components involved are in the <tt>extras/</tt>
directory of the distribution. They are discussed in
