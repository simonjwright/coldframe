<h1>ColdFrame: Event modelling</h1>

<h2>State modelling</h2>

<!--
<blockquote>
A word of warning: although Rational Rose gives you the impression
that there can be more than one state model per class, and that
statecharts and activity diagrams are different, in fact there can be
only one.
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this, you <em>must</em> mark the State/Activity Model
part of the Rose model as <i>&#171;generate&#187;</i> to show
ColdFrame that you mean it. The easiest way of doing this is in the
browser:

<p><img src="browse-state-model.png">

<p>Note also that ColdFrame requires that the <i>name</i> of the
State/Activity Model be either literally <tt>State/Activity Model</tt>
(with a possible trailing number, eg <tt>State/Activity
Model<b>2</b></tt>) or a name that can be translated into a simple Ada
name.
-->

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

<p>The vocabulary available for statechart modelling in UML is
extensive. In fact, it's so extensive that to support all of it would
be difficult, while for modellers to use all of it would be confusing
for their audience if not for themselves.

<p>ColdFrame only supports statecharts where

<ul>

<li>there are no nested states,

<li>there are no guards, and

<li>the only actions are entry actions and actions on transitions (ie,
these are slightly-extended Moore Model statecharts).

</ul>

<p>These restrictions may seem draconian, and indeed models produced
with them will tend to have more states. However, they do allow you to
make complete state models. The basic idea is that it's better to have
a small language that you understand completely rather than a bigger
but vaguer language.

<h3><a name="example-model">Example model</a></h3>

<p><a name="lamp-state.img"><img src="lamp-state.png"></a>

<p>This is a statechart for a Lamp. I assume that it's OK to turn on
the lamp if it's already on and to turn it off if it's already off;
we'd need some more intermediate states if not.

<p>The Lamp is the kind that you find on shared stairwells; it stays
on for a period of time after being switched on by a pushbutton, and
you can extend the period by pushing again while it's still on.

<ol>

<li>The state model starts at the <i>Initial</i> state (the black
spot). Since the transition from the <i>Initial</i> state requires no
event to trigger it (it's a "completion transition"), the model
immediately transitions to the <i>Idle</i> state.

<li>On entry to the <i>Idle</i> state, the entry action <i>Turn_Off</i>
is executed.

<li>The state model remains in the <i>Idle</i> state until
a <i>Lamp.Button_Push</i> event occurs. It then transitions to
the <i>Lit</i> state.

<li>On entry to the <i>Lit</i> state, the entry actions <i>Turn_On</i>
and <i>Set_Timeout</i> are executed, in the order shown in the
model. It would be possible for the timeout period to be controlled by
a Lamp instance variable, if required.

<li>If no further user action occurs, the timeout set at step 4
occurs, and the state model transitions back to the <i>Idle</i> state
(step 2), where the lamp is turned off.

<li>If on the other hand the user pushes the button again
(a <i>Lamp.Button_Push</i> event), the state model transitions to the
current (<i>Lit</i>) state, by indivisibly
<ul>

<li>calling the <i>Clear_Timeout</i> transition action which cancels
the timeout set in step 4, and

<li>re-entering this sequence at step 4.

</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Timed events</h3>

<p>The Lamp statechart involves a timeout, which is a special case of
a delayed event.

<p>Given an event, there are six things you can do with it:

<ol>

<li><i>Post</i> it, to be handled as soon as possible (in order),

<li><i>Post</i> it, to be handled at a specific time in the future,

<li><i>Post</i> it, to be handled after at least a specified interval,

<li><i>Set</i> it on a <i>Timer</i>, to be handled at a specific time
in the future,

<li><i>Set</i> it on a <i>Timer</i>, to be handled after at least a
specified interval,

<li>handle it immediately.

</ol>

<p>There are two variants of the first operation:

<dl>

<dt>plain <i>Post</i><dd>This is the normal way of posting
events. The queuing is strictly first in, first out.

<dt><a name="post-to-self"/><i>Post_To_Self</i><dd>Sometimes you
have to send an event to the current instance as a way of moving the
state machine on (perhaps you've come across an error condition). If
this happens, you need the event to take precedence over any other
events in the queue (otherwise, your event will happen after all the
instance events already in the queue).
<br>To achieve this, use <tt>Post_To_Self</tt>; any event posted in
this way takes priority over normally-posted events.
<br>"Events to self" are also queued first in, first out.

</dl>

<p>The difference between <i>Posting to be handled in the future</i>
and <i>Setting on a Timer</i> is that events that are <i>posted to be
handled in the future</i> are "fire and forget", whereas <i>Set</i>
events can be retracted. <i>Set</i> events are the kind to use for
timeouts (indeed, in state machines in general, with perhaps odd
exceptions).

<p>Note that ColdFrame requires you to cancel (<i>Unset</i>) unfired
timers before setting them again, and will also insist that a timer is
in fact <i>Set</i> before you can <i>Unset</i> it. To make up for
this, it guarantees that you can <i>Unset</i> a timer which has in
fact fired at any point before the corresponding event has actually
been handled, and the event won't be delivered.

<p>Because you need to be quite sure about whether a timer needs to be
<i>Unset</i> before being <i>Set</i> again, it's a very good idea
never to manipulate a timer except in a state machine action.

<h3>Event modelling</h3>

<p>In ColdFrame, events are always directed to a specific class. They
may be Instance Events (used in state machines), which are directed to
individual instances of the class, or Class Events (typically used for
domain isolation).

<p>However, in UML 1.4, and therefore in ArgoUML, events belong to the
package in which they're declared rather than to a class. One way of
handling this would be to put each class that has events associated
with it in its own child package; this seems rather clumsy, so
instead, prefix each event's name with the class it belongs to, as in
the <a href="#lamp-state.img">Lamp statechart</a>. When generating
code, ColdFrame discards all but the final name component (for
example, <i>Lamp.Button_Push</i> becomes <tt>Button_Push</tt> when
it's declared inside the <tt>Lamp</tt> package).

<p>It's possible to use ArgoUML's <i>Properties</i> to set
up <i>entry</i> and <i>transition</i> actions. However, because
the <i>Properties</i> dialogs are so strongly related to the (complex)
UML metamodel, it's much much easier to set them up by directly
editing the statechart. In the case of an <i>entry</i> action,
double-click in the body of the state and
type <tt>entry&nbsp;/&nbsp;Action_1;&nbsp;Action_2</tt>
(the <i>action</i> part is a semicolon-separated list of actions); in
the case of a <i>transition</i>, draw the transition, double-click in
the label and type <tt>Class.Event</tt> or, if there are
actions, <tt>Class.Event&nbsp;/&nbsp;Action_1;&nbsp;Action_2</tt>.

<h3><a name="class-events">Class events</a></h3>

<p>Instance events don't need to have any action associated with them,
if all they do is cause transitions in the statechart. However, class
events always need to have an action.

<p>In the ArgoUML-supporting version of ColdFrame, this is organised
using a <i>StateMachine</i> stereotyped <em>&#171;class&#187;</em>,
containing a dummy state and the required event/action association as
a transition:
<p><img src="button-class-state-machine.png" alt="">

<p>ArgoUML alows you to have as many <i>StateMachine</i>s on
a <i>Class</i> as you like (quite what that would mean isn't
clear). ColdFrame allows you to have at most one
unstereotyped <i>StateMachine</i>, and at most one stereotyped
&#171;class&#187;.

<p>Because you can have both, it may be best (to avoid confusing the
reader) if the events include <i>.Class</i> in the name, as
in <i>Button.Class.Button_Pushed</i> above. As before, ColdFrame
discards all but the last component of the name, so the translation
(in the <tt>Button</tt> package) will be <tt>Button_Pushed</tt>.

<p>In any case, ColdFrame requires that class events be
stereotyped <em>&#171;class&#187;</em>, as in
<p><img src="lamp-button-event-browsing.png" alt="">
<p>(note, this demonstrates the point above, that in UML events belong
to the package).

<h3>Payloads</h3>

<p>Class Events will always carry a payload (though it might be
an <a href="types.html#null-record">empty record</a>); Instance Events
need not.

<p>To model an instance event without any payload, it's only necessary
to <a href="#lamp-state.img">show it on a statechart</a>.

<p>To model a payload, enter it in the <i>Parameters</i> section of
the <i>Properties</i> tab for the event:
<p><img src="event-payload.png" alt="">

<p>There can be no more than one parameter. ColdFrame will disregard
its name, but it might as well be <i>Payload</i>!

<p>It's best if the payload doesn't contain allocated data, because
that may lead to memory leaks.

<h3>Transitions</h3>

<p>Instance events cause transitions. It's illegal for an event to
occur in a state if there's no corresponding transition from that
state (typically, a <i>Can't Happen</i> exception will be raised).

<p>If you want an event to be ignored when it occurs in a particular
state, provide a transition-to-current-state for that event and mark
it <em>&#171;ignore&#187;</em>. This means that the event is
completely ignored, and in particular any entry actions don't get
called. <em>Don't</em> do this with a completion transition (one with
no triggering event).

<p>At
present, <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=6407">ArgoUML
doesn't display the &#171;ignore&#187; stereotype on the
statechart</a>.

<p>Note that you need to reserve <i>Can't Happen</i> for when it's
logically impossible for the event to happen in the state, not just
when it's undesirable!

<h2>Class modelling</h2>

<p><img src="lamp.png">

<h3>Instance events and actions</h3>

<p>The <a href="#lamp-state.img">statechart</a> for the Lamp class
needs supporting in the class model.

<p>The instance
operations <i>Turn_On</i>, <i>Turn_Off</i>, <i>Set_Timeout</i>
and <i>Clear_Timeout</i> correspond to the entry actions on the
statechart.

<p>Instance entry and transition actions can have a single parameter
(aside from the implicit <tt>This</tt>): if you specify it, it must be
of the type of the payload of the event that causes entry to the state
concerned, and the actual payload will be passed at run time. This
means that if you use this feature, all the events that cause entry to
the state must carry the same payload type.

<p>You can use the implicitly-generated <tt>Delete</tt> operation as
an entry action (ColdFrame doesn't check that it's in a <i>final</i>
state). Of course, it needs to be the <em>last</em> action.

<p>If you need to delete the instance in any other action operation,
you must mark the operation <em>&#171;final&#187;</em>. A
&#171;final&#187; operation <em>must</em> delete the instance.

<p>The instance attribute <i>Timeout</i>, of the ColdFrame-special
type <i>Timer</i>, is used to hold timeouts. The concept of operation
for timeouts is:

<ol type="alpha">

<li>you create an event

<li>you <i>set</i> it on the timer

<li>the timer fires, and the event is posted on the event queue

<li>the event reaches the head of the event queue, and is handled.

</ol>

<p>The timer can be <i>unset</i> between the time when it's set and
the time when the event is handled; if you do this, the event won't be
delivered.

<p>If you need to have more than one concurrent timeout, allocate a
Timer variable for each.

<h3><a name="class-event-handlers">Class events and handlers</a></h3>

<p>As shown <a href="#class-events">above</a>, class events are
associated with a handler or action, in this
case <i>Button.Pushed</i>. The action must take a parameter of the
same type as the event's payload, and must be a class operation
(<i>ownerScope</i> checked in the <i>modifiers</i> section of
the <i>Properties</i> tab).

<p>Class events can be posted to run later
or <a name="class-timers"><i>Set</i> on Timers</a>; however, mixing
class timers with state machines may be a symptom of a poor state
model. You'll probably want to make the Timer concerned
a <em>&#171;class&#187;</em> attribute.
