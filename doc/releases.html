<h1>ColdFrame: Releases</h1>

<hr>

<p>Now that ColdFrame has moved
to <a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/coldframe">Github</a>,
release information will be found under
the <a href="https://github.com/simonjwright/coldframe/releases">releases
tab</a>.

<p>Note that you will see many previous "releases" there; this is
because ColdFrame was previously managed using Mercurial, which has a
different view of tags (there's no distinction between annotated and
lightweight tags, so development tags end up in the repository).

<p>These historical releases are
listed <a href="historical-releases.html">here</a>.
