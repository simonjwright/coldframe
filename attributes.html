<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>An attribute holds a property of an object (either one per
instance, for example the Accession Number of a Book in a Library, or
per class, for example the <em>next</em> Accession Number to be used).

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk (a UK thing: the circular document you display on your car's
windscreen to show you've paid the annual road tax) might be
identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark (the licence plate
number) and Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start
Date then become "identifying attributes", whereas Date Of Issue and
Period Of Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in inheritance relationships,
<li>associative classes,
<li>singletons, or
<li>types.
</ul>

All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this, ColdFrame
doesn't follow <a href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable
UML</a>; it seems risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute type <tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like
the Microsoft Access feature it's named after): each newly-created
instance gets a new value.

<h3>Types</h3>

<p>If a <a href="types.html">&#171;type&#187; class</a> has
attributes, it corresponds to a C <tt>struct</tt> or an Ada
<tt>record</tt>.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>Attributes are, of course, modelled as attributes of a UML class.

<p>In UML, an attribute is expressed as
<pre>
   &#171;stereotype&#187; <font color="red">visibility name</font> [multiplicity] <font color="red">: type-expression</font> = initial-value {property-string}
</pre>

<p>where the red parts are mandatory.

<p>Rose disobeys the standard in putting the stereotype after the
visibility indicator.
<br><i>(XXX is this true if you suppress the icon?)</i>

<p>In ColdFrame with Rose, you'd normally express the
<i>visibility</i> using the diagramming tools.

<p>ColdFrame doesn't support <i>multiplicity</i>; you'll either need
to use array <a href="types.html">types</a> or an <a
href="associations.html">association</a>.

<p>The <i>property-string</i> (a tagged value) would normally be
placed in the documentation section. It's possible to place it with
the attribute definition, but this will tend to clutter the diagram.

<h3>Stereotypes</h3>

<dl>

<dt><tt>id</tt>
<dd>The attribute is an identifying attribute.

<dt><tt>class</tt>
<dd>The attribute is a class attribute.

</dl>

<h3><a name="tags">Tagged values</a></h3>

<dl>

<dt><tt><a name="formalizes">formalizes</a> = <i>association-name</i></tt>
<dd>Indicates that the attribute is a
referential attribute.

<p>This is needed when the attribute has to be specified by the
analyst (normally, ColdFrame can manage references as required).

<p>Consider R8, Licence is-issued-by Licensing Office. The identifier
of Licence consists of the licence number and also the issuing
Licensing Office, since the various offices don't use disjoint licence
number ranges. In this case, we'd specify the attributes as
<pre>
  &#171;id&#187; number : Positive
  &#171;id&#187; issuing office : Licensing Office
</pre>

and include the tag
<pre>
  { formalizes = r8 }
</pre>

in the documentation section for <i>issuing office</i>; or,
alternatively (and if you don't mind the diagram clutter)
<pre>
  &#171;id&#187; number : Positive
  &#171;id&#187; { formalizes = r8 } issuing office : Licensing Office
</pre>


</dl>

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>Attributes of types are implemented as Ada record components.

<p>Ordinary attributes of classes are implemented in the "instance
record", accessed as <tt>This.<i>attribute-name</i></tt>.

<p>Class attributes are implemented as variables in the private part
of the class package, and are accessed directly by name.
