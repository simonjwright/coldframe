<h1>ColdFrame: Event use</h1>

<h2>Event queues</h2>

<p>All code is executed in the context of some Ada task. There are
three relevant kinds of task:

<ul>

<li>the environment task (the main program),

<li>the task associated with an instance of an &#171;active&#187; class,

<li>the <i>dispatcher</i> task associated with an event queue,

</ul>

<p>and you must make sure that a domain's data is manipulated in a way
that's safe from concurrent access by more than one of these tasks.

<p>A common pattern, which might be called <em>"access domain data
from domain events"</em>, is shown in the sequence diagram below. In
it, the only task which accesses a domain's data is the
<i>dispatcher</i> task associated with its event queue.

<p><img src="house-management-operation.png">

<p>All code in the discussion below is from the House Management
domain in the <tt>example/</tt> subdirectory of the distribution.

<p><em>Operation 1</em> occurs in the Digital IO domain, in the
context of Digital IO's event queue.

<p><em>Operation 1.1</em> is the callback of the registered operation
<tt>Button.Changed</tt>, still in Digital IO's context. This creates a
new <tt>Button Event</tt>, whose payload is the pushed button's name
(<em>Operation 1.1.1</em>), and posts it onto House Management's event
queue (<em>Operation 1.1.2</em>):
<pre>
   declare
      E : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
	:= new Button_Event;
      P : Button_Name renames Button_Event (E.all).Payload;
   begin
      P := Buttons (S.S);
      ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (E, On => Events.Dispatcher);
   end;
</pre>

<p><em>Operation 2</em> represents the firing of the <tt>Button
Event</tt> when it reaches the head of the House Management event
queue, in the House Management context. The generated <tt>Handler</tt>
calls the &#171;handler&#187; operation <tt>Button.Pushed</tt>
(<em>Operation 2.1</em>), which, instead of posting another event,
creates a <tt>Button Push</tt> event for the Lamp concerned
(<em>Operation 2.1.1</em>) on the stack and then invokes its generated
<tt>Handler</tt> (<em>Operation 2.1.2</em>):
<pre>
   procedure Button_Pushed (L : Lamp.Handle) is
      Ev : Lamp.Button_Push (For_The_Instance => L);
   begin
      Lamp.Handler (Ev);
   end Button_Pushed;
</pre>

<p>The generated body of <tt>Lamp.Handler</tt> includes the code
<pre>
   case This.State_Machine_State is
      when Idle =>
	 This.Old_State_Machine_State := Idle;
	 This.State_Machine_State := Lit;
	 Turn_On (This);
	 Set_Timeout (This);
</pre>

<p>which corresponds to <em>Operation 2.1.2.1</em> and <em>Operation
2.1.2.2</em> and completes the processing.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>This style of event processing, which could be called
<i>synchronous</i>, is subject to one limitation: if an action needs
to create an event <em>on the same instance of the same class</em>,
the event must be posted rather than being processed
synchronously. There's no logical difference between the synchronous
and posting styles; posting is more consistent, while synchronous is
more efficient (it saves a memory allocation/freeing and a couple of
context switches, perhaps 20 to 30 microseconds).


<h2>Posting an event</h2>

The typical code for posting an event <tt>Ev</tt> is
<pre>
   ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (Ev, On => Events.Dispatcher);
</pre>

<p>Clearly <tt>Ev</tt> has to be created. If it's a class event of
type <tt>Wait</tt> to class <i>Class</i>, this would be
<pre>
   Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
     := new Class.Wait;
</pre>

<p>whereas if it's an instance event, and we have a handle <tt>H</tt>,
it would be
<pre>
   Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
     := new Class.Done (H);
</pre>

<p>If you need to set the payload, add a renaming:
<pre>
   Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
     := new Class.Info;
   Payload : Message renames Class.Info (Ev.all).Payload;
</pre>

<p>where
<ul>

<li><tt>Ev.all</tt> is of type
<tt>ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_Base'Class</tt>,

<li><tt>Class.Info (Ev.all)</tt> is a view conversion to
<tt>Class.Info</tt>,

<li>after which you can set up the payload before posting the event.

</ul>

<p>In total,
<pre>
   declare
      Ev : constant ColdFrame.Project.Events.Event_P
        := new Class.Info;
      Payload : Message renames Class.Info (Ev.all).Payload;
   begin
      Payload := Some_Value;
      ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (Ev, On => Events.Dispatcher);
   end;
</pre>

<p>Of course, if you don't need a payload, it's much simpler:
<pre>
   ColdFrame.Project.Events.Post (new Class.Done (H),
                                  On => Events.Dispatcher);
</pre>


<h2><a name="locking">Locking</a></h2>

<p>An earlier version of the <a
href="event-modelling.html#example-model">example state model</a> was

<p><img src="lamp-state-resetting.png">

<p>If the task executing <a
href="event-translation.html#is_on"><tt>Is_On</tt></a> isn't the same
one as that executing the state machine, there is a possibility that
<tt>Is_On</tt> may catch the instance in an intermediate state (in
this case, the state <tt>Resetting</tt>). There are two approaches to
this problem.

<p>In the simpler, it's clear that <tt>Resetting</tt> is an
intermediate state; the state machine bounces immediately back to
<tt>On</tt> via an unguarded transition, so
<tt>Is_On</tt> could be coded
<pre>
   function Is_On (This : Handle) return Boolean is
   begin
      return This.State_Machine_State = On
               or else This.State_Machine_State = Resetting;
   end Is_On;
</pre>

<p>If the simple approach isn't good enough, it's possible to
<i>lock</i> the domain's event queue:
<pre>
   function Is_On (This : Handle) return Boolean is
      L : ColdFrame.Project.Events.Lock (Events.Dispatcher);
      pragma Warnings (Off, L);
   begin
      return This.State_Machine_State = On;
   end Is_On;
</pre>

<p>After the <tt>Lock</tt> <tt>L</tt> has been elaborated,
ColdFrame guarantees that

<ul>

<li>there are no outstanding self events on <tt>Dispatcher</tt>

<li>no further events will be dispatched by <tt>Dispatcher</tt> until
<tt>L</tt> is destroyed (by going out of scope).

</ul>

<p>Note that there's no guarantee about the relative timing of events
and locks; you could post an event and then take a lock, but the event
may or may not have been handled when the lock is achieved.
