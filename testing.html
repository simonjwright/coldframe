<h1>ColdFrame: Testing</h1>

<p>There are (at least) two levels of testing that you may wish to do
on ColdFrame-supported domains: <a href="testing-class.html">class-level</a>, which is a white-box
approach to test the internal structures of the domain, and
<a href="testing-domain.html">domain-level</a>, which is a black-box
approach to test the behaviour of the domain as a whole, and is likely
to be quite functional and requirements-oriented.

<p>Both levels will benefit from the use
of <a href="stubs.html">stubs</a>.
