<h1>ColdFrame: Event modelling</h1>

<h2>State modelling</h2>

<blockquote>
A word of warning: although Rational Rose gives you the impression
that there can be more than one state model per class, and that
statecharts and activity diagrams are different, in fact there can be
only one.
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this, you <em>must</em> mark the State/Activity Model
part of the Rose model as <i>&#171;generate&#187;</i> to show
ColdFrame that you mean it. The easiest way of doing this is in the
browser:

<p><img src="browse-state-model.png">

<p>Note also that ColdFrame requires that the <i>name</i> of the
State/Activity Model be either literally <tt>State/Activity Model</tt>
(with a possible trailing number, eg <tt>State/Activity
Model<b>2</b></tt>) or a name that can be translated into a simple Ada
name.

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

<p>The vocabulary available for statechart modelling in UML is
extensive. In fact, it's so extensive that to support all of it would
be difficult, while for modellers to use all of it would be confusing
for their audience if not for themselves.

<p>ColdFrame only supports statecharts where

<ul>

<li>there are no nested states,

<li>there are no guards, and

<li>the only actions are entry actions and actions on transitions (ie,
these are slightly-extended Moore Model statecharts).

</ul>

<p>These restrictions may seem draconian, and indeed models produced
with them will tend to have more states. However, they do allow you to
make complete state models. The basic idea is that it's better to have
a small language that you understand completely rather than a bigger
but vaguer language.

<h3><a name="example-model">Example model</a></h3>

<p><a name="lamp-state.img"><img src="lamp-state.png"></a>

<p>This is a statechart for a Lamp. I assume that it's OK to turn on
the lamp if it's already on and to turn it off if it's already off;
we'd need some more intermediate states if not.

<p>The Lamp is the kind that you find on shared stairwells; it stays
on for a period of time after being switched on by a pushbutton, and
you can extend the period by pushing again while it's still on.

<ol>

<li>The state model starts at the <i>initial</i> state (the black
spot). Since the transition from the <i>initial</i> state requires no
event to trigger it (it's a "completion transition"), the model
immediately transitions to the <i>idle</i> state.

<li>On entry to the <i>idle</i> state, the entry action <i>turn off</i>
is executed.

<li>The state model remains in the <i>idle</i> state until a <i>push</i>
event occurs. It then transitions to the <i>lit</i> state.

<li>On entry to the <i>lit</i> state, the entry actions <i>turn on</i>
and <i>set timeout</i> are executed, in the order shown in the
model. It would be possible for the timeout period to be controlled by
a Lamp instance variable, if required.

<li>If no further user action occurs, the timeout set at step 4
occurs, and the state model transitions back to the <i>idle</i> state
(step 2), where the lamp is turned off.

<li>If on the other hand the user pushes the button again, the state
model transitions to the current (<i>lit</i>) state, by indivisibly
<ul>

<li>calling the <i>clear timeout</i> transition action which cancels
the timeout set in step 4, and

<li>re-entering this sequence at step 4.

</ul>

</ol>

<h3>Timed events</h3>

<p>The Lamp statechart involves a timeout, which is a special case of
a delayed event.

<p>Given an event, there are six things you can do with it:

<ol>

<li><i>Post</i> it, to be handled as soon as possible (in order),

<li><i>Post</i> it, to be handled at a specific time in the future,

<li><i>Post</i> it, to be handled after at least a specified interval,

<li><i>Set</i> it on a <i>Timer</i>, to he handled at a specific time
in the future,

<li><i>Set</i> it on a <i>Timer</i>, to he handled after at least a
specified interval,

<li>handle it immediately.

</ol>

<p>There are two variants of the first operation:

<dl>

<dt>plain <i>Post</i><dd>This is the normal way of posting
events. The queuing is strictly first in, first out.

<dt><a name="post-to-self"/><i>Post To Self</i><dd>Sometimes you
have to send an event to the current instance as a way of moving the
state machine on (perhaps you've come across an error condition). If
this happens, you need the event to take precedence over any other
events in the queue (otherwise, your event will happen after all the
events already in the queue).
<br>To achieve this, use <tt>Post_To_Self</tt>; any event posted in
this way takes priority over normally-posted events.
<br>"Events to self" are also queued first in, first out.

</dl>

<p>The difference between <i>Posting to be handled in the future</i>
and <i>Setting on a Timer</i> is that events that are <i>posted to be
handled in the future</i> are "fire and forget", whereas <i>Set</i>
events can be retracted. <i>Set</i> events are the kind to use for
timeouts (indeed, in state machines in general, with perhaps odd
exceptions).

<p>Note that ColdFrame requires you to cancel (<i>Unset</i>) unfired
timers before setting them again, and will also insist that a timer is
in fact <i>Set</i> before you can <i>Unset</i> it. To make up for
this, it guarantees that you can <i>Unset</i> a timer which has in
fact fired at any point before the corresponding event has actually
been handled, and the event won't be delivered.

<p>Because you need to be quite sure about whether a timer needs to be
<i>Unset</i> before being <i>Set</i> again, it's a very good idea
never to manipulate a timer except in a state machine action.

<h3>Event kinds and payloads</h3>

<p>Events are always directed to a specific class. They may be
Instance Events (used in state machines), which are directed to
individual instances of the class, or Class Events (typically used for
domain isolation).

<p>Class Events will always carry a payload; Instance Events need not.

<p>To model an instance event without any payload, it's only necessary
to <a href="#lamp-state.img">show it on a statechart</a>.

<p>To model an event with a payload, show a dependency, named with the
event name and stereotyped <em>&#171;instance&nbsp;event&#187;</em> or
<em>&#171;class&nbsp;event&#187;</em> as appropriate, from the class
to the <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> involved; this is shown in <a
href="#lamp.png">the diagram below</a>.

<p>It's best if the payload doesn't contain allocated data, because it
may lead to memory leaks (this depends on the way the support software
works).

<p>You need a <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> to model an event with a
payload, but it doesn't have to be a special
<em>&#171;type&#187;</em>. Also, you can use the same
<em>&#171;type&#187;</em> as the payload for several different events.

<p>You always need instance events to manage state machines, even if
the class concerned is a <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<h3>Transitions</h3>

<p>Instance events cause transitions. It's illegal for an event to
occur in a state if there's no corresponding transition from that
state (typically, a <i>Can't Happen</i> exception will be raised).

<p>If you want an event to be ignored when it occurs in a particular
state, provide a transition-to-current-state for that event and mark
it <em>&#171;ignore&#187;</em>. This means that the event is
completely ignored, and in particular any entry actions don't get
called. <em>Don't</em> do this with a completion transition (one with
no triggering event).

<p>Note that you need to reserve <i>Can't Happen</i> for when it's
logically impossible for the event to happen in the state, not just
when it's undesirable!

<h2>Class modelling</h2>

<p><a name="lamp.png"><img src="lamp.png"></a>

<h3>Instance events and actions</h3>

<p>The <a href="#lamp-state.img">statechart</a> for the Lamp class
needs supporting in the class model.

<p>The instance operations <i>turn on</i>, <i>turn off</i>, <i>set
timeout</i> and <i>clear timeout</i> correspond to the entry actions
on the statechart.

<p>Instance entry and transition actions can have a single parameter
(aside from the implicit <tt>This</tt>): if you specify it, it must be
of the type of the payload of the event that causes entry to the state
concerned, and the actual payload will be passed at run time. This
means that if you use this feature, all the events that cause entry to
the state must carry the same payload type.

<p>You can use the implicitly-generated <tt>Delete</tt> operation as
an entry action (ColdFrame doesn't check that it's in a <i>final</i>
state). Of course, it needs to be the <em>last</em> action.

<p>If you need to delete the instance in any other action operation,
you must mark the operation <em>&#171;final&#187;</em>. A
&#171;final&#187; operation <em>must</em> delete the instance.

<p>The instance attribute <i>timeout</i>, of the ColdFrame-special
type <i>Timer</i>, is used to hold timeouts. The concept of operation
for timeouts is:

<ol type="alpha">

<li>you create an event

<li>you <i>set</i> it on the timer

<li>the timer fires, and the event is posted on the event queue

<li>the event reaches the head of the event queue, and is handled.

</ol>

<p>The timer can be <i>unset</i> between the time when it's set and
the time when the event is handled; if you do this, the event won't be
delivered.

<p>If you need to have more than one concurrent timeout, allocate a
Timer variable for each.

<h3><a name="class-event-handlers">Class events and handlers</a></h3>

<p>In addition, the class diagram shows
<i>&#171;class&nbsp;event&#187;</i> support.

<p>Instance events are about state machines; class events are mainly
intended for use where you have <a
href="event-motivation.html">communication between domains</a>.

<p>There is a <i>Button</i> class event <i>Button&nbsp;Event</i>,
which carries a payload of type <i>Button Name</i>.

<p>The event is handled by the operation <i>pushed</i>; ColdFrame
knows this because

<ol type="alpha">

<li>the operation is stereotyped <i>&#171;handler&#187;</i>

<li>it has a single parameter of type <i>Button&nbsp;Event</i>.

</ol>

<p><a name="class-timers">Class events can be <i>set</i> on
Timers</a>; you'll probably want to make the Timer concerned
a <em>&#171;class&#187;</em> attribute.
