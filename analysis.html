<h1>ColdFrame: Analysis</h1>

<p>People often think that the right place to start an analysis is in
front of a computer running a UML modelling tool. This approach is
tempting but wrong, for several reasons.

<h2>Requirements and design</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to work out what the problem domain is and
what the constraints (performance, safety, security, environment,
legal etc) are. In an older (some would say, more mature) way of doing
things, this would have been an appropriate time to produce
an <a
href="http://www.pogner.demon.co.uk/mil_498/sdd-did.htm#scope">SDD</a>. In
the UML world, this need is possibly best met by using Use Cases or at
least user stories, with at least two intended audiences:

<ul>

<li>The person, architect or systems engineer, who has to sign off on
the proposed development and (later) remember how it fits into the
greater scheme; and

<li>The person who has to develop and (later) maintain the model.

</ul>

<p>However, remember that Use Cases only make up about 30% of a
typical requirement statement.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Even when the requirements are clear, it's still not time to start
drawing UML models on the computer. It usually takes several
iterations before you have a model that begins to reflect the problem
domain, and it's much cheaper to sketch it out, in pencil or (not so
good) on a whiteboard. Modelling in a tool offers far too much
opportunity to waste time by making a bad model look good, and also
gives a spurious air of correctness which a pencil sketch in your
notebook doesn't. Make notes! Especially, make notes on why a
particular design
<em>didn't</em> work! You might find that a Wiki- or blog-based
approach works for this phase, provided it's acceptable in your
workplace.

<h2>Good models</h2>

<p>High-level languages such as Ada and C++ show the benefits of
strong typing; it makes it easier to write code that 'does the right
thing', if done properly, because it constrains the code that can be
written so that many mistakes can be caught by compilers.

<p>A crisp UML model offers similar benefits.

<p>First, the modeller needs to understand, and make clear to the
reader, what each entity in the model means and why it is there. This
will mean writing clear descriptions of the classes, the attributes,
the associations and the roles. Unfortunately, that probably won't be
enough; the model is essentially flat, and the reader needs some
guidance on how things fit together; some sort of roadmap. Internal
use cases, possibly expressed in sequence diagrams, may help here; but
it's a bad idea to insist on too high a level of detail too soon (for
example, insisting on defining operations rather than messages).
