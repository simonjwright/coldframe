<dl>

<dt>0009 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if the <tt>Create</tt> and <tt>Find</tt>
operations of child classes checked that the given identifier (of the
parent class's instance) isn't <tt>null</tt>.

<dt>0010 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if active tasks' procedures (which call the
corresponding entries) trapped and reported exceptions.

<dt>0012 (raised 12.vii.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if exception handlers could be automatically
generated in stub subprograms.

<dt>0014 (raised 13.vii.01)

<dd>No code is generated for operations of &#171;type&#187;s.

<dt>0016 (raised 6.viii.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if an association class could be automatically
generated for many-to-many associations where the analyst hasn't
provided one already.

<dt>0018 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>For efficiency, classes whose identifier has a limited range (eg,
Forward/Aft or 1..10) should be implemented with array-like behaviour.

<dt>0019 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>It would be good to support private operations (particularly for
active classes, where procedure operations turn into task entries).

<dt>0025 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if illegal characters in names were detected.

<dt>0027 (raised 5.x.01)

<dd>For attributes and operation parameters, it would be good to
detect missing types (or names).

<dt>0031 (raised 13.x.01)

<dd>&#171;finalize&#187; operations which are functions or have
parameters (or are &#171;class&#187; operations, though you would have
to work hard to make one both!) are silently <em>not</em> called at
finalization. There are other instances of bad usage which need
reporting (perhaps in a separate pass?)

<dt>0035 (raised 1.xi.01)

<dd>The association support packages generated when one of the parties
in a 1:1 association is a &#171;singleton&#187; won't work if the
non-singleton party is marked <tt>[[source]]</tt>.

<dt>0037 (raised 16.xi.01)

<dd>Would it be better only to generate task entries when there's an
&#171;entry&#187; stereotype?

<dt>0043 (raised 28.xi.01)

<dd>It may be desirable to allow <tt>[[callback]]</tt>s to be
targeted to specific instances of a particular class.

<dt>0047 (raised 6.xii.01)

<dd>It might be useful to be able to describe <i>array</i>
&#171;type&#187;s.

<dt>0049 (raised 27.xii.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if project-specific configuration
information (such as multiplicities) could be supplied in a separate
document from the domain model.

<dt>0050 (raised 27.xii.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if the multiplicity of an association
class was calculated automatically (where the multiplicity of each
associated class is specified).

<dt>0055 (raised 8.i.02)

<dd>To create an instance of a child class (or any class that has a
reference to another class in its identifier), you have to type
convert the <tt>Handle</tt> to
<tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt>.<br> This could be avoided by
making (all?) <tt>Create</tt> operations children of the class
package.

<dt>0056 (raised 8.i.02)

<dd>The generated HTML doesn't report default parameter values.

<dt>0059 (raised 16.i.02)

<dd>It would be proper to use UML tagged values instead of
<tt>[[&nbsp;]]</tt> annotations.

<dt>0062 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>It would be useful to be able to specify constants.

<dt>0065 (raised 28.ii.02)

<dd>The mechanism for handling multiple case exception files isn't
easy to reconcile with use in Makefiles. Probably needs to use an
environment variable.

<dt>0066 (raised 5.iii.02)

<dd>Making generated real types <tt>new</tt> will mean lots of
instantiations of
<tt>Ada.Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions</tt>. Perhaps subtypes
of <tt>Float</tt>, <tt>Long_Float</tt> would be better.

<dt>0067 (raised 5.iii.02)

<dd>If the action associated with a timed event sets the just-fired
timer again, there's a race condition which can result in a Use_Error
exception.

<!-- next: 0068 -->

</dl>

<h2><a name="fixed">Fixed</a></h2>

<h3>4.iii.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0054 (raised 8.i.02)

<dd>Attribute, parameter and result types in the generated HTML should
be hyperlinked to their definitions (unless they're standard).

<dt>0063 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>It would be useful to be able to specify class variables.

<dt>0064 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>There's no documentation on how to set up the Makefiles, how to
use on Linux vs Windows etc.

</dl>

<h3>24.i.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0026 (raised 4.x.01)

<dd>It should probably be possible for an operation to take or return
a collection of its own class. At present this gives rise to a cyclic
dependency.<br>

<i>"Fix" is to withdraw the <tt>[[set]]</tt> facility. The way to get
hold of collections of instances is to use the <tt>All_Instances</tt>,
<tt>Selection/Filter_Function</tt>, and association navigation
facilities.</i>

<dt>0033 (raised 30.x.01)

<dd>The generated HTML for <i>&#171;class&#187; op (this : Class)</i>
is <tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt>; should be just
<tt>Handle</tt>.

</dl>

<h3>17.i.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0060 (raised 17.i.02)

<dd>Imported and renamed types can lead to excessively long source
lines.

</dl>

<h3>16.i.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0058 (raised 16.i.02)

<dd>The installable Makefiles (<tt>Makefile-winnt</tt>,
<tt>Makefile-unix</tt>) ought to make code generation depend on the
user <tt>Makefile</tt>; because she can change macro values in it.

</dl>

<h3>13.i.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0057 (raised 10.i.02)

<dd>Please can the number of lines of code generated be reported (for
example, in the header comments of the main domain package).

</dl>

<h3>3.i.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0051 (raised 2.i.02)

<dd>In inheritance trees, the parents may not have been processed when
the grandchildren are processed, resulting in failed normalization.

<dt>0052 (raised 2.i.02)

<dd>The Makefiles expect a Case Exception File, and normalization
fails if it's not present.<br>

<dt>0053 (raised 2.i.02)

<dd>Model domains are extracted for all selected packages, not just
those in the current diagram.

<dt>0061 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>The supplied Windows makefile (<tt>Makefile-winnt</tt>) assumes
software is installed on the <tt>D:</tt> drive; better if the default
was <tt>C:</tt>. <i>The customer bug report came after the problem was
fixed.</i>

</dl>

<h3>11.xii.01</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0046 (raised 28.xi.01)

<dd>The intended use of <tt><i>Association</i>.Unlink</tt> isn't
clear.

<dt>0048 (raised 11.xii.01)

<dd>Using escapable HTML entities (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;) in the
Documentation section prevents proper processing of annotations.

<br>
<i>Use a newer <a href="resources.html#xml">TclXML</a> release
(tclxml-2.1theta works fine).</i>

</dl>

<h3>3.xii.01</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0044 (raised 28.xi.01)

<dd>The <i>Autonumber</i> facility is implemented using plain
<tt>Integer</tt>s. This might cause integer overflow under heavy
long-term use.

</dl>

<h3>29.xi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0020 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>Cardinalities and multiplicities of the form 1..42 should be
recognised (even if not implemented as specified: a warning would be
sensible in that case).

<dt>0038 (raised 16.xi.01)

<dd>&#171;abstract&#187; procedure operations of active classes
generate task entries. They probably shouldn't.

<dt>0042 (raised 28.xi.01)

<dd>Operations of <tt>[[imported]]</tt> types aren't visible.

<dt>0045 (raised 28.xi.01)

<dd>Multiplicity and cardinality processing in normalization only
recognizes the <i>n</i> forms; the official <i>*</i> forms should be
supported too.

</dl>

<h3>19.xi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0041 (raised 19.xi.01)

<dd><tt>[[callback]]</tt> doesn't work on plain types, you need to use
a record.<br>
<i>An error is reported.</i>

</dl>

<h3>17.xi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0036 (raised 16.xi.01)

<dd>The domain <tt>Initialize</tt> procedure should be a child
unit. As it is, a <tt>with</tt> of the domain package, probably for
its types, calls in all the class packages that have &#171;init&#187;
operations.

<dt>0040 (raised 17.xi.01)

<dd>&#171;generated&#187; and &#171;navigation&#187; procedure
operations of active classes generate task entries.

</dl>

<h3>16.xi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0030 (raised 13.x.01)

<dd>&#171;finalize&#187; operations shouldn't be inherited.

<dt>0034 (raised 1.xi.01)

<dd>&#171;finalize&#187; operations of active classes shouldn't be
mapped to task entries.

<dt>0039 (raised 16.xi.01)

<dd><tt>Tear_Down</tt> should clear out any registered Callbacks.

</dl>

<h3>29.x.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0028 (raised 12.x.01)

<dd>The WITH TYPE extension seems to trigger a lot of instability in
GNAT. An alternative would be better.

<dt>0032 (raised 28.x.01)

<dd>With multiple inheritance, ColdFrame doesn't necessarily choose
the right parent class to call inherited operations.

</dl>

<h3>13.x.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0029 (raised 12.x.01)

<dd>The generated Tear_Down procedure bodies have unused WITH clauses.

</dl>

<h3>28.ix.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0017 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>It would be good if the generated hash functions made some attempt
to actually hash.

</dl>

<h3>26.ix.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0022 (raised 14.ix.01)

<dd>It should be easier to iterate over Collections.

<dt>0023 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if discriminated record types could be
generated.

<dt>0024 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>The generated domain <tt>Tear_Down</tt> procedure has a bad body
if there are no Classes (just Types) in the domain.

</dl>

<h3>14.ix.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0021 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>Identifier normalization should match GLIDE's casing rules.

</dl>

<h3>6.viii.01</h3>
<dl>
<dt>0015 (raised 1.viii.01)

<dd>The generated code should include indications of the date of
extraction and the revisions of the tools concerned (or perhaps of
ColdFrame itself).

</dl>

<h3>13.vii.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0013 (raised 12.vii.01)

<dd><tt>Initialize</tt> procedures should only be generated (and
called by the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>) where the Model specifies a
parameterless &#171;class&#187; procedure <tt>Initialize</tt>.

</dl>

<h3>7.vii.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0011 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd><tt>Unlink</tt> operations on simple associations should null out
referential attributes.

</dl>

<h3>28.vi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0008 (raised 26.vi.01)

<dd>Class operations of active classes generate an entry and a
matching (bad) body stub.

</dl>

<h3>26.vi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0004 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The <tt>Link</tt> function for a 1-(1:1) association is generated
wrongly (uses the wrong end of the association).

<dt>0007 (raised 26.vi.01)

<dd>The error message generated when there's no concrete
implementation of an abstract operation is garbled.

</dl>

<h3>21.vi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0001 (raised 21.vi.01)

<dd>If an operation takes a parameter of the current class, or returns
a value of the current class, CF generates a "with" of the current
class (resulting in a circular dependency).

<dt>0002 (raised 21.vi.01)

<dd>Active Interfaces don't declare the type Instance before it's used.

<dt>0003 (raised 21.vi.01)

<dd>Associations with Singletons aren't supported properly.

</dl>

<h2><a name="rejected">Rejected</a></h2>

<h3>4.xii.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0005 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The translation for active classes fails when the <tt>[[max]]</tt>
number of instances is specified.<br>
<i>Can't reproduce this.</i>

<dt>0006 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The translation for active classes requires users to jump through
hoops involving <tt>.all'Unrestricted_Access</tt> to get a
<tt>Handle.</tt><br>
<i>A simple <tt>Handle&nbsp;(This)</tt> type conversion will do the
trick, not so bad I think.</i>
