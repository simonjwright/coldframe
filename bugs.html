<h2>Outstanding</h2>

<dl>

<dt>0005 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The translation for active classes fails when the <tt>[[max]]</tt>
number of instances is specified.

<dt>0006 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The translation for active classes requires users to jump through
hoops involving <tt>.all'Unrestricted_Access</tt> to get a
<tt>Handle.</tt>

<dt>0009 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if the <tt>Create</tt> and <tt>Find</tt>
operations of child classes checked that the given identifier (of the
parent class's instance) isn't <tt>null</tt>.

<dt>0010 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if active tasks' procedures (which call the
corresponding entries) trapped and reported exceptions.

<dt>0012 (raised 12.vii.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if exception handlers could be automatically
generated in stub subprograms.

<dt>0014 (raised 13.vii.01)

<dd>No code is generated for operations of &#171;type&#187;s.

<dt>0016 (raised 6.viii.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if an association class could be automatically
generated for many-to-many associations where the analyst hasn't
provided one already.

<dt>0018 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>For efficiency, classes whose identifier has a limited range (eg,
Forward/Aft or 1..10) should be implemented with array-like behaviour.

<dt>0019 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>It would be good to support private operations (particularly for
active classes, where procedure operations turn into task entries).

<dt>0020 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>Cardinalities and multiplicities of the form 1..42 should be
recognised (even if not implemented as specified: a warning would be
sensible in that case).

<dt>0025 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if illegal characters in names were detected.

<dt>0026 (raised 4.x.01)

<dd>It should probably be possible for an operation to take or return
a collection of its own class. At present this gives rise to a cyclic
dependency.

<h2>Fixed</h2>

<h3>28.ix.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0017 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>It would be good if the generated hash functions made some attempt
to actually hash.

</dl>

<h3>26.ix.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0022 (raised 14.ix.01)

<dd>It should be easier to iterate over Collections.

<dt>0023 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if discriminated record types could be
generated.

<dt>0024 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>The generated domain <tt>Tear_Down</tt> procedure has a bad body
if there are no Classes (just Types) in the domain.

</dl>

<h3>14.ix.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0021 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>Identifier normalization should match GLIDE's casing rules.

</dl>

<h3>6.viii.01</h3>
<dl>
<dt>0015 (raised 1.viii.01)

<dd>The generated code should include indications of the date of
extraction and the revisions of the tools concerned (or perhaps of
ColdFrame itself).

</dl>

<h3>13.vii.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0013 (raised 12.vii.01)

<dd><tt>Initialize</tt> procedures should only be generated (and
called by the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>) where the Model specifies a
parameterless &#171;class&#187; procedure <tt>Initialize</tt>.

</dl>

<h3>7.vii.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0011 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd><tt>Unlink</tt> operations on simple associations should null out
referential attributes.

</dl>

<h3>28.vi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0008 (raised 26.vi.01)

<dd>Class operations of active classes generate an entry and a
matching (bad) body stub.

</dl>

<h3>26.vi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0004 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The <tt>Link</tt> function for a 1-(1:1) association is generated
wrongly (uses the wrong end of the association).

<dt>0007 (raised 26.vi.01)

<dd>The error message generated when there's no concrete
implementation of an abstract operation is garbled.

</dl>

<h3>21.vi.01</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0001 (raised 21.vi.01)

<dd>If an operation takes a parameter of the current class, or returns
a value of the current class, CF generates a "with" of the current
class (resulting in a circular dependency).

<dt>0002 (raised 21.vi.01)

<dd>Active Interfaces don't declare the type Instance before it's used.

<dt>0003 (raised 21.vi.01)

<dd>Associations with Singletons aren't supported properly.

</dl>
