<dt>0010 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if active tasks' procedures (which call the
corresponding entries) trapped and reported exceptions.

<dt>0012 (raised 12.vii.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if exception handlers could be automatically
generated in stub subprograms.

<dt>0016 (raised 6.viii.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if an association class could be automatically
generated for many-to-many associations where the analyst hasn't
provided one already.

<dt>0018 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>For efficiency, classes whose identifier has a limited range (eg,
Forward/Aft or 1..10) should be implemented with array-like behaviour.

<dt>0019 (raised 4.ix.01)

<dd>It would be good to support private operations (particularly for
active classes, where procedure operations turn into task entries).

<dt>0031 (raised 13.x.01)

<dd>&#171;finalize&#187; operations which are functions or have
parameters (or are &#171;class&#187; operations, though you would have
to work hard to make one both!) are silently <em>not</em> called at
finalization. There are other instances of bad usage which need
reporting (perhaps in a separate pass?)

<dt>0035 (raised 1.xi.01)

<dd>The association support packages generated when one of the parties
in a 1:1 association is a &#171;singleton&#187; won't work if the
non-singleton party is marked <tt>[[source]]</tt>.

<dt>0037 (raised 16.xi.01)

<dd>Would it be better only to generate task entries when there's an
&#171;entry&#187; stereotype?

<dt>0047 (raised 6.xii.01)

<dd>It might be useful to be able to describe <i>array</i>
&#171;type&#187;s.

<dt>0049 (raised 27.xii.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if project-specific configuration
information (such as multiplicities) could be supplied in a separate
document from the domain model.

<dt>0050 (raised 27.xii.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if the multiplicity of an association
class was calculated automatically (where the multiplicity of each
associated class is specified).

<dt>0056 (raised 8.i.02)

<dd>The generated HTML doesn't report default parameter values.

<dt>0059 (raised 16.i.02)

<dd>It would be proper to use UML tagged values instead of
<tt>[[&nbsp;]]</tt> annotations.

<dt>0062 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>It would be useful to be able to specify constants.

<dt>0065 (raised 28.ii.02)

<dd>The mechanism for handling multiple case exception files isn't
easy to reconcile with use in Makefiles. Probably needs to use an
environment variable.

<dt>0067 (raised 5.iii.02)

<dd>If the action associated with a timed event sets the just-fired
timer again, there's a race condition which can result in a Use_Error
exception.

<dt>0068 (raised 6.iii.02)

<dd>It would be useful to be able to specify subtypes (eg, of
enumerations).

<dt>0071 (raised 19.iii.02)

<dd>It would be useful to be able to use Pi (<tt>Ada.Numerics.Pi</tt>)
in type range specifications.

<dt>0072 (raised 19.iii.02)

<dd>It seems unnecessary that the <tt>[[callback]]</tt> facility
requires you to specify the maximum number of instances.

<dt>0078 (raised 18.iv.02)

<dd>It would be helpful if ColdFrame could detect the error of having
non-unique abbreviations.

<dt>0080 (raised 1.v.02)

<dd>In multiple inheritance, would it be possible for an operation
inherited from one parent to act as the concrete version of an
abstract operation declared in the other parent?

<dt>0086 (raised 14.v.02)

<dd>It would be helpful if the build process could report
unimplemented bodies.

<dt>0088 (raised 7.vi.02)

<dd>Extraction hangs if the output directory (<tt>ColdFrameOut</tt> in
the Path Map) doesn't exist.

<dt>0090 (raised 7.vi.02)

<dd>It should be possible to declare &#171;type&#187;s "private" (this
would only make sense if they have operations, I suppose).

<dt>0094 (raised 24.vi.02)

<dd>It's not possible to have automatically-generated accessors for
class variables.

<dt>0098 (raised 25.vi.02)

<dd>Multiple delayed events which are required to fire at the same
time will result in a <tt>delay&nbsp;0.0</tt> between each.

<dt>0105 (raised 23.vii.02)

<dd>If an enumeration type is imported or renamed, the enumeration
literals aren't.

<dt>0109 (raised 19.viii.02)

<dd>The error where a state has more than one exiting transition
triggered by the same event (or drop-through) isn't detected.

<dt>0111 (raised 2.ix.02)

<dd>It would make testing easier if non-&#171;public&#187; classes
could be generated as non-<tt>private</tt> Ada packages.

<dt>0120 (raised 19.ix.02)

<dd>Extraction from Rose doesn't notice if a Domain package isn't
actually loaded. The result is a very sparsely-populated domain.

<br><i>Extraction now loads packages that aren't already loaded.</i>

<dt>0121 (raised 19.ix.02)

<dd>Using the Windows environment variable <tt>ColdFrameOut</tt>
causes trouble under Cygwin; it comes out as <tt>COLDFRAMEOUT</tt>.

<br><i>Rolled over; now in upper case.</i>

<dt>0122 (raised 19.ix.02)

<dd>Tear-down of Event Queues results in strange

state variable contained the new state rather than the old one.

<br><i>There are two instance variables: <tt>State_Machine_State</tt>
and <tt>Old_State_Machine_State</tt>. Inside an action,

<dd>There's no support for deleting instances in <i>final</i> states.

<dt>0113 (raised 9.ix.02)

<dd>The <tt>Wait_Until_Idle</tt> operation isn't as useful as it could
be if you have timeouts (because there's almost always something held
on the event queue).

<br><i><tt>Wait_Until_Idle</tt> now has an optional
parameter<tt>Ignoring_Timers</tt> (defaulted to <tt>False</tt>) which
controls whether <i>Timer</i>s are included in the count.</i>

<dt>0116 (raised 12.ix.02)

doesn't compile.

<h3>10.ix.02</h3>

<dt>0114 (raised 10.ix.02)

<dd>The warning given when a role's multiplicity has a specific upper
bound greater than one (ie, not 1 or *) isn't very helpful.

<dt>0115 (raised 10.ix.02)

<dd>Creation events for singletons aren't coded properly.

<h3>8.ix.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0110 (raised 2.ix.02)

<dd>The <tt>Lock</tt> features of the standard Event Queue will result
in a deadly embrace if used by two domains sharing the same event
queue.

<dt>0112 (raised 5.ix.02)

<dd>There'll be a memory leak if a domain is <tt>Initialize</tt>d more
than once.

<br><i><tt>Tear_Down</tt> allows (requires!) the domain to be
re-<tt>Initialize</tt>d.</i>

</dl>

<h3>19.viii.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0097 (raised 25.vi.02)

<dd>All the Events that transition to a State with an Action with a
parameter must be the same. It would be helpful if this could be
changed to "must carry the same payload".

</dl>

<h3>17.viii.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0073 (raised 11.iv.02)

<dd>If a class has a multiplicity of 0..1, it should be possible to
<tt>Find</tt> the only instance (or of course <tt>null</tt>) without
supplying an Identifier.

<br><i>Both <tt>Find</tt>s are generated; the one which requires an
Identifier is "deprecated".</i>

<dt>0081 (raised 9.v.02)

<dd>Tear_Down doesn't clean up singletons (especially active ones).

<dt>0087 (raised 21.v.02)

<dd><tt>Tear_Down</tt> doesn't reset &#171;class&#187; variables.

<br><i>It's actually the <tt>Class_Initialize</tt> operation that does
this.</i>

<dt>0103 (raised 16.vii.02)

<dd>Automatic formation of abbreviations can result in generating
reserved words.

<br><i>If this condition occurs, an error is reported.</i>

<br><i>Other uses of reserved words are also reported as errors.</i>

<dt>0106 (raised 25.vii.02)

<dd>The generated lines-of-code count is wrong, and less useful than
it could be.

<br><i>It's now correct (though still not so useful).</i>

<dt>0107 (raised 25.vii.02)

<dd>It would be a good thing if documentation in the model could be
carried through into the generated code.

<dt>0108 (raised 16.viii.02)

<dd>The style of programming implied by the present version of
<tt>ColdFrame.Project.Calendar</tt> (a renaming of
<tt>Ada.Calendar</tt>) falls foul of a GNAT feature which fails when
you <tt>with</tt> two renamings of the same package.

<h3>16.vii.02</h3>

<dt>0102 (raised 15.vii.02)

linked.

</dl>

<h3>10.vii.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0027 (raised 5.x.01)

detect missing types (or names).

<h3>7.vii.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0092 (raised 24.vi.02)

<dd>There's no <tt>Tear_Down</tt> for Event management.

<h3>4.v11.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0095 (raised 25.vi.02)

<dd>Operations of &#171;type&#187;s are generated even if they're
marked &#171;generated&#187; (which means that they're operations that
ColdFrame generates automatically).

<dt>0100 (raised 4.vii.01)

<dd>Signed initializers aren't supported.

</dl>

<h3>27.vi.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0079 (raised 1.v.02)

<dd>It would be helpful if there was a means of declaring exceptions.

<dt>0099 (raised 27.vi.02)

<dd>Association across reflexive associations is incorrect.

<br><i>Actually, it's not; but there needs to be more documentation on
how to think about role names.</i>

</dl>

<h3>25.vi.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0093 (raised 24.vi.02)

<dd>Deleting an instance may hang if there are no timed events
outstanding.

<dt>0096 (raised 25.vi.02)

<dd>Operations of &#171;type&#187;s don't compile.

</dl>

<h3>8.vi.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0089 (raised 7.vi.02)

<dd>Reflexive associations (without an associative class) generate
code that doesn't compile (especially if the cardinality of the class
involved has been specified).

</dl>

<h3>29.v.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0009 (raised 27.vi.01)

<dd>It would be helpful if the <tt>Create</tt> and <tt>Find</tt>
operations of child classes checked that the given identifier (of the
parent class's instance) isn't <tt>null</tt>.

<br>Actually, this comes down to checking in <tt>Create</tt> that no
identifying referential attribute is <tt>null</tt>. As for
<tt>Find</tt>, there seems no particular reason to check.

</dl>

<h3>20.v.02</h3>

<dl>

<dt>0075 (raised 16.iv.02)

<dd>Some of the generated operations (eg, accessors for referential
attributes) are only intended to be called by generated code. It would
be good to indicate this somehow.

<dt>0083 (raised 14.v.02)

<dd>&#171;access&#187; functions are generated as though they were
procedures.

<dt>0084 (raised 14.v.02)

<dd>ColdFrame ought to respect the modeller's casing; if you say
<i>FOO</i> it should come out as <tt>FOO</tt>.

<i>
<br>This change has two consequences:

<ul>

<li>you need to be consistent about case; the code generator is
case-sensitive

<li>you need to use the case that ColdFrame expects (for example,
<tt>AutoNumber</tt> won't work)
</ul>
</i>

<dt>0085 (raised 14.v.02)

<dd>ColdFrame generates accessors for referential attributes, but they
aren't intended for general use. Can they be marked "private" in the
generated code?

<br><i>See also 0075.</i>

</dl>

<h3>9.v.02</h3>
<dt>0025 (raised 26.ix.01)

<dd>It would be a good thing if illegal characters in names were detected.

<dt>0082 (raised 9.v.02)

<dd>Tear_Down of an active non-singleton doesn't clean up the
associated task.

<dl>

</dl>

<h3>18.iv.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0077 (raised 18.iv.02)

<dd>If a class has a one-word name, the automatically-generated
abbreviation is a single letter. It's a nuisance to have to think of
an abbreviation for each such class.

<br><it>The default "abbreviation" for a single-word class is made by
prepending <tt>A</tt> or <tt>An</tt>.</it>

</dl>

<h3>17.iv.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0076 (raised 17.iv.02)

<dd>In inheritance hierarchies, bad code is generated for operation
parameters whose type is the class in which the operation is declared.

</dl>

<h3>12.iv.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0074 (raised 11.iv.02)

<dd>On Windows, an error in code generation doesn't cause the Make
process to quit (so you get a truncated Ada output file rather than
none).<br>

<i>Fix is to use <tt>instantsaxon</tt> version 6.5.1 or later.</i>

</dl>

<h3>18.iii.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0070 (raised 15.iii.02)

<dd>For large domains, the Makefile can generate command lines too
long for (the Cygwin) <tt>bash</tt>.

</dl>

<h3>9.iii.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0066 (raised 5.iii.02)

<dd>Making generated real types <tt>new</tt> will mean lots of
instantiations of
<tt>Ada.Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions</tt>. Perhaps subtypes
of <tt>Float</tt>, <tt>Long_Float</tt> would be better.

<dt>0069 (raised 8.iii.02)

be hyperlinked to their definitions (unless they're standard).

<dt>0063 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>It would be useful to be able to specify class variables.

<dt>0064 (raised 23.i.02)

use on Linux vs Windows etc.

</dl>

<h3>24.i.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0026 (raised 4.x.01)

<dd>It should probably be possible for an operation to take or return
a collection of its own class. At present this gives rise to a cyclic
dependency.<br>

<i>"Fix" is to withdraw the <tt>[[set]]</tt> facility. The way to get
hold of collections of instances is to use the <tt>All_Instances</tt>,
<tt>Selection/Filter_Function</tt>, and association navigation
facilities.</i>

<dt>0033 (raised 30.x.01)

<dt>0058 (raised 16.i.02)

<dd>The installable Makefiles (<tt>Makefile-winnt</tt>,

<h3>3.i.02</h3>
<dl>

<dt>0051 (raised 2.i.02)

<dd>In inheritance trees, the parents may not have been processed when
the grandchildren are processed, resulting in failed normalization.

<dd>The Makefiles expect a Case Exception File, and normalization
fails if it's not present.<br>

<dt>0053 (raised 2.i.02)

<dd>Model domains are extracted for all selected packages, not just
those in the current diagram.

<dt>0061 (raised 23.i.02)

<dd>The supplied Windows makefile (<tt>Makefile-winnt</tt>) assumes
software is installed on the <tt>D:</tt> drive; better if the default

<dd>To create an instance of a child class (or any class that has a
reference to another class in its identifier), you have to type
convert the <tt>Handle</tt> to <tt>ColdFrame.Instances.Handle</tt>.

<br><i>This problem was most tedious with inheritance hierarchies. The
new inheritance support removes most of the problem.</i>

<dd>It may be desirable to allow <tt>[[callback]]</tt>s to be
targeted to specific instances of a particular class.

<br>This can be done with the <i>Counterpart</i> facility, if
required.

<dd>It would be helpful if an association with an unnamed role could
be identified more precisely ("unnamed role in association" isn't very
good!)

<br><i>This only happens when the association itself isn't named. Not
much we can do.</i>

number of instances is specified.<br>
<i>Can't reproduce this.</i>

<dt>0006 (raised 25.vi.01)

<dd>The translation for active classes requires users to jump through
hoops involving <tt>.all'Unrestricted_Access</tt> to get a
<tt>Handle.</tt><br>
<i>A simple <tt>Handle&nbsp;(This)</tt> type conversion will do the
trick, not so bad I think.</i>
