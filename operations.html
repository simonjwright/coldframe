<h1>ColdFrame: Operations</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The purpose of operations is to implement the actual functionality
of the domain.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>Operations are used

<ul>

<li><a href="#basic">to provide basic functionality</a>,

<li><a href="#accessor">to provide access to instance and class variables</a>,

<li><a href="#init">to provide initialization (of the domain)</a>,

<li><a href="#final">to support finalization (of instances)</a>,

<li><a href="#unit">to support unit test</a>,

<li>to support state machines,

<li>to process class (non-state machine) events,

<li>to process callbacks from other domains,

<li><a href="#type">to define access-to-subprogram types</a>,

<li><a href="#entry">to define task or protected type entries</a>,

<li><a href="#seq">to support sequence diagrams</a>.

</ul>

<p><a href="#renaming">Renamings</a> are provided to allow a form of
overloading.

<h3><a name="basic">Basic functionality</a></h3>

<p>For classes, you must only have one operation with a given name,
except for &#171;entry&#187;s and <a
href="#renaming">renamings</a>. It's allowed to have operations with
the same name as generated subprograms (<tt>Create</tt>, <tt>Find</tt>
and <tt>Delete</tt>), but you do need to ensure that the parameter
profiles don't clash.

<p>You can't overload operations of &#171;type&#187;s at all.

<p>Class operations (no <tt>This</tt> parameter will be generated) are
marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;class&#187;</em>.

<p>Dispatching operations are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em>. The operation will be implemented in a
child class.

<h3><a name="accessor">Accessors</a></h3>

<p>Instance and class variables are private, regardless of what you
say in the model. You can create accessor operations (see below) and
you can mark them <em>&#171;accessor&#187;</em> as a documentation
aid.

<p>For an attribute <tt><i>Attr</i></tt>, an operation is a "set"
accessor if it is a procedure named <tt>Set_<i>Attr</i></tt> with a
single parameter of the same type as <tt><i>Attr</i></tt>, and an
operation is a "get" accessor if it is a function named
<tt>Get_<i>Attr</i></tt> with no parameters returning a value of the
same type as <tt><i>Attr</i></tt>.

<p>The "class-ness" of the attribute and the operation must match. If
you have a class accessor, you can mark it just &#171;class&#187;; if
you wish to mark it as an accessor as well,
say &#171;class,&nbsp;accessor&#187; or &#171;accessor,&nbsp;class&#187;.

<h3><a name="init">Domain initialization</a></h3>

<p>Operations to be called from the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>
procedure are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em>. This implies the stereotype
<em>&#171;class&#187;</em>. These operations must be parameterless
procedures.

<h3><a name="final">Finalization of instances</a></h3>

<p>Operations to be called to clean up as an instance is deleted (for
example, to tidy up associations) are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;finalize&#187;</em>. (It would be possible in theory to use
Ada's controlled types, but that depends on your target language being
Ada). Also, it's possible to have more than one &#171;finalize&#187;
operation.

<h3><a name="unit">Unit test support</a></h3>

<p>Operations to be called during teardown (in unit test) are marked
with the stereotype <em>&#171;teardown&#187;</em>. It's possible to
have more than one &#171;teardown&#187; operation. These are intended
to clean up resources such as file descriptors; don't try to tidy up
associations, they're in an indeterminate state during teardown.

<br>&#171;finalize&#187; operations can call &#171;teardown&#187;s.

<h3><a name="type">Access-to-subprogram types</a></h3>

<p><em>&#171;access&#187;</em> indicates that the operation is in fact
an access type (pointer-to-subprogram with the indicated profile).

<h3><a name="entry">Entries</a></h3>

<h4><a name="task-entry">Task entries</a></h4>

<p>In an <i>active</i> class, you can specify task entries using the
<em>&#171;entry&#187;</em> stereotype. It's permissible to have an
ordinary operation with the same name as an &#171;entry&#187;, because
&#171;entry&#187; operations don't generate normal subprograms.

<h4><a name="protected-type-entry">Protected type entries</a></h4>

<p>In a &#171;protected&#187; type, you can nominate procedures
(operations without a return value) as entries using the
<em>&#171;entry&#187;</em> stereotype.

<h3><a name="seq">Sequence diagram support</a></h3>

<p>Use <em>&#171;generated&#187;</em> for operations which are
automatically generated by ColdFrame but which you need to be present
so that they can be used on sequence diagrams (eg, <tt>Find</tt>,
<tt>Delete</tt>, <tt>All_Instances</tt>).  If you don't use the
stereotype, ColdFrame will generate an ordinary user operation as well
as the automatic one, which will probably be illegal and certainly
confusing.

<p><em>&#171;navigation&#187;</em> is similar to
<em>&#171;generated&#187;</em>; the idea is for you to use it when you
want to show navigating associations on sequence diagrams. You might
use a naming convention like <tt>r2.appears on</tt> (an operation of
<i>Screen</i> that returns a collection of <i>Window</i>s).

<p><em>&#171;instantiation&#187;</em> is similar to
<em>&#171;generated&#187;</em>; the idea is for you to use it when you
want to show local-to-operation instantiations of generics provided by
ColdFrame (eg, <tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Selection_Function</tt>) on
sequence diagrams.

<h3><a name="renaming">Renaming</a></h3>

<p>You can use the <tt><i>renames</i></tt> tag to specify a
form of overloading (ColdFrame's translation approach rules out actual
overloading). Ada semantics apply (for example, you can change
parameter defaults).

<p>The form is <tt>{ renames = <i>other-operation</i> }</tt>.

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>Operations which are present <a href="#seq">to support sequence
diagrams</a> generate no code.

<p><a href="#type">Access-to-subprogram types</a> map to type
declarations in the domain package specification (for those declared
in &#171;type&#187;s) or the class package specification (for those
declared in classes).

<p><a href="#task-entry">Task entries</a> map to <tt>entry</tt>
specifications in the class's task specification.

<p>Operations and <a href="#protected-type-entry">entries</a> of
protected types map to operations and entries in the type
specification (in the domain package specification) and in the type's
separate proper body.

<p><a name="accessor">Accessors</a> map to declarations in the class
package specification and proper bodies in the class package body.

<p>Other operations are generated as

<ul>

<li>declarations in the appropriate package specification,

<li>body stubs in the corresponding package body, and

<li><tt>separate</tt> proper bodies <i>(this is the reason why all the
operations of all but protected types, and all the operations of a
class bar entries, must have distinct names; see <a
href="http://www.adapower.com/rm95/arm95_161.html">ARM 10.1.3</a>
(14))</i>.

</ul>

<p>Operations with returns (<i>op():type-name</i> in the model) are
implemented as functions.
