<h1>ColdFrame: Preparation</h1>

<h2>Executable UML aspects</h2>

<p>It's not possible here to give a detailed tutorial on the
Executable UML approach. <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Leon Starr's book</a> is an
excellent reference. Note also that complete Executable UML support
involves full translation of the code of operations and actions as
well as the generation of the framework which is all that ColdFrame
attempts (this year).

<h3>Reserved Names</h3>

<p>You will need to avoid using certain names in your models, because
they are already used by ColdFrame's implementation.

<p>The actual reserved names depend on the translation rules adopted,
and are specified with the <a href="target.html">target platform</a>.

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk (a UK thing: the circular document you display on your car's
windscreen to show you've paid the annual road tax) might be
identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark (the licence plate
number) and Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start
Date then become "identifying attributes", whereas Date Of Issue and
Period Of Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in inheritance relationships,
<li>associative classes,
<li>singletons, or
<li>types.
</ul>

<p>All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this,
ColdFrame doesn't
follow <a href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable
UML</a>; it seems risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute type <tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like
the Microsoft Access feature it's named after): each newly-created
instance gets a new value.

<h3>Associations and role names</h3>

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the object
of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name, the
subject is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might have
<em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>.

<p><img src="window-screen.jpg">

<p>Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing.

<h3>Associations and multiplicity</h3>

<p>You need to think carefully about the multiplicity of associations;
they capture application rules and policies, which it's important to
get right.

<p>Clearly each <em>Screen</em> <em>"displays"</em> a number
of <em>Window</em>s, but can a <em>Window</em> <em>"appear on"</em>
more than one <em>Screen</em>? (perhaps, if you have multi-headed
display capability). Can you have a <em>Window</em> which <em>"appears
on"</em> no <em>Screen</em>s? (well, no, not if your display
technology is X--in which case <em>"appears on"</em> may not be quite
right either, since the application could be iconised).

<p>Unconditional multiplicity is good; if each end of an association
is conditional (0..1, 0..n), maybe you should think more carefully
about it. Perhaps there's some super/subtype (inheritance)
relationship lurking in there.

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>Most programming languages implement inheritance in a way that
supports static classification (a Cat is-a Animal). Once you've got a
Cat, an Animal it stays!

<p>On the other hand, if you're thinking at the analysis level, you
can see that at different stages of its lifecycle an object can take
part in different relationships.

<p><img src="inheritance.png">

<p>The attribute <i>termination</i> only has meaning if the van is on
hire (it's the date when it's due back), so we shouldn't leave it
lying around in the parent <i>Van</i> class. Also, the association
<i>r3</i>, <i>Hired Van</i> <i>is-on-loan-to</i> <i>Customer</i> is
unconditional, which is good.

<p>Note also the way <i>r1</i>, which maintains the service history of
the <i>Van</i>, is independent of whether the <i>Van</i> is currently
hired out or in the pool.

<p>At present (2 Feb 2002), ColdFrame expects the set of child
instances to be complete, which is why <i>Pool Van</i> appears in the
model above. Every <i>Van</i> must be either a <i>Hired Van</i> or a
<i>Pool Van</i>. This only actually shows up in implementing
dispatching operations; if you try calling a dispatching operation for
an instance without a current child you'll get a
<tt>Constraint_Error</tt>. Often you'll find something interesting to
say about all the child classes; in the example, it seems likely that
only <i>Pool Van</i>s can be sent for servicing.

<h3>Polymorphism and dispatching</h3>

<p>ColdFrame supports polymorphism. Instance operations marked
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em> are dispatched to the current child
(skipping down the inheritance tree until a concrete implementation is
found), while a child class receives upward-dispatching
implementations of all normal concrete parental instance operations.

<h3>Containers</h3>

<p>Resist the temptation to put containers in the model. In <em>Window
"appears on" Screen</em>, the association itself models the user
concept of "each screen displays a list of windows" (actually,
thinking about it, I'm not at all sure that the actual user ever had
the concept "list" in mind at all. She's much more likely to have said
"each screen displays a <em>number</em> of windows". I think this
"list" was implanted there by some ex-programmer with a solution in
mind, rather than by someone listening to the customer!)

<h3>Formalising associations</h3>

<p>In the original Shlaer-Mellor method, associations and inheritance
relationships needed to be "formalised" by the use of "referential
attributes". Considering the <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>,
where clearly there are many <em>Window</em>s but only one
<em>Screen</em>, you'd need a referential attribute
<em>screen&nbsp;id</em> in the <em>Window</em> instance.

<p>ColdFrame, however, follows <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable UML</a>; you
usually don't need to provide referential attributes (it would be
quite cumbersome to do so, since Rose, a typical UML tool, is unaware
of the concept). Instead, ColdFrame automatically implements the
relationships. Sometimes it needs a little help, for example for <a
href="attributes.html#formalizes">complex formalization</a> or <a
href="#source">in a symmetric association</a>.

<h2>Use of Stereotypes</h2>

<h3>On packages</h3>

<p>Normally, ColdFrame doesn't descend into UML packages inside the
domain package. You might have classes that you don't want to generate
code for (perhaps they're not complete; perhaps they represent other
domains).

<p>However, you may find it handy to reduce clutter in the browser
panel to put some classes into child packages; for example, all the
&#171;type&#187;s. In this case, you do want to generate code for
them; so mark the child package as <em>&#171;generate&#187;</em>.

<p>&#171;generate&#187; has the semantics of "include" - there's no
hierarchy in the generated code.

<h3>On classes</h3>

<p>Classes which represent user-defined types are marked with the
stereotype <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>.

<p>Classes of which there is always precisely one instance are marked
with the stereotype <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>Public classes, which are the only classes visible from outside the
Domain, are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>. This implies the stereotype
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>. Public classes can't take part in
relationships.

<p>Abstract classes (which must be parents in inheritance
relationships) may be marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em>. This has no effect on code generation
at present (3.i.02). <em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em> is an alternative
to the use of the <i>Abstract</i> checkbox in the Rose <i>Class
Specification</i> dialog (<i>Detail</i> tab).

<h3>On attributes</h3>

<p>Identifying attributes are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;id&#187;</em>.

<p>Class attributes are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;class&#187;</em>.

<h3>On operations</h3>

<p>Dispatching operations are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em>. The operation will be implemented in a
child class.

<p><em>&#171;access&#187;</em> indicates that the operation is in fact
an access type (pointer-to-subprogram with the indicated profile).

<p>Class operations (no <tt>This</tt> parameter will be generated) are
marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;class&#187;</em>.

<p>Operations to be called from the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>
procedure are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em>. This implies the stereotype
<em>&#171;class&#187;</em>. These operations must be parameterless
procedures.

<p>If an operation used as a state machine action deletes the
instance, if must be stereotyped <em>&#171;final&#187;</em>.

<p>Operations to be called to clean up as an instance is deleted (for
example, to tidy up associations) are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;finalize&#187;</em>. (It would be possible in theory to use
Ada's controlled types, but that depends on your target language being
Ada). Also, it's possible to have more than one &#171;finalize&#187;
operation.

<p>Use <em>&#171;generated&#187;</em> for operations which are
automatically generated by ColdFrame but which you need to be present
so that they can be used on sequence diagrams (eg, <tt>Find</tt>,
<tt>Delete</tt>, <tt>All_Instances</tt>).  If you don't use the
stereotype, ColdFrame will generate an ordinary user operation as well
as the automatic one, which will probably be illegal and certainly
confusing.

<p><em>&#171;navigation&#187;</em> is similar to
<em>&#171;generated&#187;</em>; the idea is for you to use it when you
want to show navigating associations on sequence diagrams. You might
use a naming convention like <tt>r2.appears on</tt> (an operation of
<i>Screen</i> that returns a collection of <i>Window</i>s).

<p><em>&#171;instantiation&#187;</em> is similar to
<em>&#171;generated&#187;</em>; the idea is for you to use it when you
want to show local-to-operation instantiations of generics provided by
ColdFrame (eg, <tt><i>Domain.Class</i>.Selection_Function</tt>) on
sequence diagrams.

<h2><a name="annotation">Other annotations</a></h2>

<p>It's not at all convenient to put all the extra information you
need for code generation into stereotypes. Instead, UML tagged values
are used, usually in the documentation section (in Rose the bottom
left pane); for example, for your local type <i>Socket</i>,
<tt>{&nbsp;renames&nbsp;=&nbsp;GNAT.Sockets.Socket_Type&nbsp;}</tt>.

<p>Any unrecognised tagged values are included in the normalized XML
as attributes, so that you can add your own post-processing (for
example, <a href="extending.html">special code generation
methods</a>).

<p>ColdFrame originally used <a
href="annotations.html">annotations</a>, only available in the
documentation section, in sections delimited by <tt>[[&nbsp;]]</tt>;
for example,
<tt>[[&nbsp;renames&nbsp;:&nbsp;GNAT.Sockets.Socket_Type&nbsp;]]</tt>.

<p>Tagged values are supported:

<dl>

<dt><a href="domains.html#tags">on domains</a><dd>
<p>

<dt><a href="classes.html#tags">on classes</a><dd>
<p>

<dt><a href="types.html#tags">on <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> classes</a><dd>
<p>

<dt><a href="attributes.html#tags">on attributes</a><dd><p>

<dt>on operations<dd><ul>

<li><tt>convention = <i>language</i></tt> indicates that the operation
is to be callable using the conventions of <i>language</i>.
<br>The most common use will be <tt>convention=C</tt>.

</ul>

<dt>on roles<dd><ul>

<li><a name="source"><tt>source</tt></a> indicates that the class at
this end is the source of the formalisation for the association: only
useful for symmetrical associations <i>1:1</i>, <i>1c:1c</i>,
<i>1-(1:1)</i> or <i>1-(1c:1c)</i>, for which it is required.

</ul>

</dl>

<p>You can have as many tagged value sections per documentation
section as you like, and each section can contain a comma-separated
list of tagged values (so a value can't contain a comma, hence the
restriction on <tt>revision</tt>).
