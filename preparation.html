<h1>ColdFrame: Preparation</h1>

<h2>ArgoUML aspects</h2>

<p>Installation and setup (overall and project-specific) is
covered <a href="argouml-installation.html">elsewhere</a>.

<p>However, ArgoUML's default format for saving a project is in a
zip-compressed <tt>.zargo</tt> file. Compressed (ie binary) files
don't work very well with most revision control systems, so (although
ColdFrame will handle <tt>.zargo</tt> files) it's probably best to
save in <tt>.uml</tt> form.

<h2>Executable UML aspects</h2>

<p>It's not possible here to give a detailed tutorial on the
Executable UML approach, though some thoughts are presented <a
href="analysis.html">here</a>. <a
href="resources.html#build-object-models">Leon Starr's book</a> is an
excellent reference. Note also that complete Executable UML support
involves full translation of the code of operations and actions as
well as the generation of the framework which is all that ColdFrame
attempts (this year).

<h3>Reserved Names</h3>

<p>You will need to avoid using certain names in your models, because
they are already used by ColdFrame's implementation.

<p>The actual reserved names depend on the translation rules adopted,
and are specified with the <a href="target.html">target platform</a>.

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk (a UK thing, up to October 2014: the circular document you
displayed on your car's windscreen to show you'd paid the annual road
tax) might be identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark (the
licence plate number) and Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and
Validity Start Date then become "identifying attributes", whereas Date
Of Issue and Period Of Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you <em>must not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in inheritance relationships,
<li>associative classes,
<li>singletons, or
<li>types.
</ul>

<p>All other classes <em>must</em> have identifiers. In this,
ColdFrame doesn't
follow <a href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable
UML</a>; it seems risky to apply too many defaults.

<p>For the case where there's no suitable naming attribute, ColdFrame
provides the attribute type <tt><i>Autonumber</i></tt> (rather like
the Microsoft Access feature it's named after): each newly-created
instance gets a new value.

<h3>Associations and role names</h3>

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the object
of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name, the
subject is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might have
<em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>.

<p><img src="window-screen.jpg">

<p>Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing.

<h3>Associations and multiplicity</h3>

<p>You need to think carefully about the multiplicity of associations;
they capture application rules and policies, which it's important to
get right.

<p>Clearly each <em>Screen</em> <em>"displays"</em> a number
of <em>Window</em>s, but can a <em>Window</em> <em>"appear on"</em>
more than one <em>Screen</em>? (perhaps, if you have multi-headed
display capability). Can you have a <em>Window</em> which <em>"appears
on"</em> no <em>Screen</em>s? (well, no, not if your display
technology is X--in which case <em>"appears on"</em> may not be quite
right either, since the application could be iconised).

<p>Unconditional multiplicity is good; if each end of an association
is conditional (0..1, 0..n), maybe you should think more carefully
about it. Perhaps there's some super/subtype (inheritance)
relationship lurking in there.

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>Most programming languages implement inheritance in a way that
supports static classification (a Cat is-a Animal). Once you've got a
Cat, an Animal it stays!

<p>On the other hand, if you're thinking at the analysis level, you
can see that at different stages of its lifecycle an object can take
part in different relationships.

<p><img src="inheritance.png">

<p>The attribute <i>termination</i> only has meaning if the van is on
hire (it's the date when it's due back), so we shouldn't leave it
lying around in the parent <i>Van</i> class. Also, the association
<i>r3</i>, <i>Hired Van</i> <i>is-on-loan-to</i> <i>Customer</i> is
unconditional, which is good.

<p>Note also the way <i>r1</i>, which maintains the service history of
the <i>Van</i>, is independent of whether the <i>Van</i> is currently
hired out or in the pool.

<p>ColdFrame expects the set of child instances to be complete, which
is why <i>Pool Van</i> appears in the model above. Every <i>Van</i>
must be either a <i>Hired Van</i> or a
<i>Pool Van</i>. This only actually shows up in implementing
dispatching operations; if you try calling a dispatching operation for
an instance without a current child you'll get a
<tt>Constraint_Error</tt>. Often you'll find something interesting to
say about all the child classes; in the example, it seems likely that
only <i>Pool Van</i>s can be sent for servicing.

<h3>Polymorphism and dispatching</h3>

<p>ColdFrame supports polymorphism. Instance operations marked
<em>abstract</em> are dispatched to the current child (skipping down
the inheritance tree until a concrete implementation is found), while
a child class receives upward-dispatching implementations of all
normal concrete parental instance operations.

<h3>Containers</h3>

<p>Resist the temptation to put containers in the model. In <em>Window
"appears on" Screen</em>, the association itself models the user
concept of "each screen displays a list of windows" (actually,
thinking about it, I'm not at all sure that the actual user ever had
the concept "list" in mind at all. They're much more likely to have said
"each screen displays a <em>number</em> of windows". I think this
"list" was implanted there by some ex-programmer with a solution in
mind, rather than by someone listening to the customer!)

<h3>Formalising associations</h3>

<p>In the original Shlaer-Mellor method, associations and inheritance
relationships needed to be "formalised" by the use of "referential
attributes". Considering the <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>,
where clearly there are many <em>Window</em>s but only one
<em>Screen</em>, you'd need a referential attribute
<em>screen&nbsp;id</em> in the <em>Window</em> instance.

<p>ColdFrame, however,
follows <a href="resources.html#build-object-models">Executable
UML</a>; you usually don't need to provide referential attributes (it
would be quite cumbersome to do so, since ArgoUML, a typical UML tool,
is unaware of the concept). Instead, ColdFrame automatically
implements the relationships. Sometimes it needs a little help, for
example for <a href="attributes.html#formalizes">complex
formalization</a> or <a href="#source">in a symmetric association</a>.

<h2>Use of Stereotypes</h2>

<p>These are some examples of the more common uses of stereotypes. The
full list of ColdFrame's <a href="ColdFrameProfile.html#Stereotypes">
stereotypes</a>, <a href="ColdFrameProfile.html#Tags">tagged
values</a> and <a href="ColdFrameProfile.html#Types">basic types</a>
are listed in
the <a href="ColdFrameProfile.html#Stereotypes">profile</a>.

<h3>On packages</h3>

<p>ColdFrame searches the ArgoUML <tt>.uml</tt> file for packages
stereotyped <em>&#171;domain&#187;</em>. All the classes, types and
relationships that make up the domain are in this package and its
children (recursively).

<p>You may find it handy to reduce clutter in the browser panel by
putting some classes into child packages; for example, all the types.

<p>To make unit tests easier, it can help to separate those Public
classes and types in the domain that form the interface it presents to
other domains into one of the child packages, stereotyped
<em>&#171;domain-interface&#187;</em> (and, by convention,
called <tt><i>Domain Name</i> Interface</tt>).

<h3>On classes</h3>

<p>The ArgoUML implementation of <em>DataType</em> doesn't provide any
visualisation of types with attributes, so classes which represent
user-defined types are marked with the
stereotype <em>&#171;datatype&#187;</em>.

<p>Classes of which there is always precisely one instance are marked
with the stereotype <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>Public classes, which are the only classes visible from outside the
Domain, are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>. This implies the stereotype
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>. Public classes can't take part in
relationships.

<h3>On attributes</h3>

<p>Identifying attributes are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;id&#187;</em>.

<h3>On operations</h3>

<p>Operations to be called from the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>
procedure are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em>. These operations must be parameterless
procedures.

<p>If an operation used as a state machine action deletes the
instance, it must be stereotyped <em>&#171;final&#187;</em>.

<p>Operations to be called to clean up as an instance is deleted (for
example, to tidy up associations) are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;finalize&#187;</em>. (It would be possible in theory to use
Ada's controlled types, but that depends on your target language being
Ada). Also, it's possible to have more than one &#171;finalize&#187;
operation.

<h2>Tagged Values</h2>

<p>In UML 1.4, tagged values are considered to be properties of
stereotypes, so ColdFrame specifies which tagged values are permitted
for each stereotype in
the <a href="ColdFrameProfile.html#Tags">profile</a>.

<p>In previous versions of ColdFrame, using Rational Rose as the front
end, this was not the case, and tagged values could be inserted freely
in, for example, documentation sections. This feature is no longer
available.

<h2>Extending ColdFrame</h2>

<p>In previous versions of ColdFrame it was possible to support
extensions:

<blockquote>
Any unrecognised tagged values are included in the normalized XML as
attributes, so that you can add your own post-processing (for example,
special code generation methods).
</blockquote>

<p>This is no longer the case; an equivalent facility may be
reintroduced in a future release.

<!--
<p>It's not at all convenient to put all the extra information you
need for code generation into stereotypes. Instead, UML tagged values
are used, usually in the documentation section (in Rose the bottom
left pane); for example, for your local type <i>Socket</i>,
<tt>{&nbsp;renames&nbsp;=&nbsp;GNAT.Sockets.Socket_Type&nbsp;}</tt>.

<p>Any unrecognised tagged values are included in the normalized XML
as attributes, so that you can add your own post-processing (for
example, <a href="extending.html">special code generation
methods</a>).

<p>ColdFrame originally used <a
href="annotations.html">annotations</a>, only available in the
documentation section, in sections delimited by <tt>[[&nbsp;]]</tt>;
for example,
<tt>[[&nbsp;renames&nbsp;:&nbsp;GNAT.Sockets.Socket_Type&nbsp;]]</tt>.

<p>Tagged values are supported:

<ul>

<li><a href="domains.html#tags">on domains</a>

<li><a href="classes.html#tags">on classes</a>

<li><a href="types.html#tags">on <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> classes</a>

<li><a href="attributes.html#tags">on attributes</a>

<li>on operations

<ul>

<li><tt>convention = <i>language</i></tt> indicates that the operation
is to be callable using the conventions of <i>language</i>.
<br>The most common use will be <tt>convention=C</tt>.

</ul>

<li>on roles

<ul>

<li><a name="source"><tt>source</tt></a> indicates that the class at
this end is the source of the formalisation for the association: only
useful for symmetrical associations <i>1:1</i>, <i>1c:1c</i>,
<i>1-(1:1)</i> or <i>1-(1c:1c)</i>, for which it is required.

</ul>

</ul>
