<title>ColdFrame: Architecture</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1>ColdFrame: Architecture</h1>

The first version of ColdFrame contains a single software
architecture. This involves:

<ul>

<li><a href="#target">a target platform</a>,

<li><a href="#strategy">a strategy</a>,

<li><a href="#preparation">preparation of models in Rational Rose</a>,

<li><a href="#extraction">extraction of models from Rose</a>,

<li><a href="#conversion">conversion to standard form</a>,

<li><a href="#generation">generation of code</a>,

<li>using <a href="#support">specially written support components</a>

<li>and a set of <a href="use-of-bcs.html">generic container
components</a>.

</ul>

<p>You can see a UML <a href="coldframe-architecture.pdf">diagram</a>
of the current architecture, together with <a
href="coldframe-architecture.html">descriptions</a> of the classes
involved.

<h2><a name="target">Target platform</a></h2>

<p>The target is a memory-resident Ada software architecture (for
example, a <a href="http://www.windriver.com/">VxWorks</a>-based
controller).

<h2><a name="strategy">Strategy</a></h2>

<p>It's fundamental to the idea of ColdFrame that you don't need to
build a design model by decorating your clean, beautiful analysis
model with all sorts of support clutter (lists, queues etc). The
software architect decides how analysis models are to be translated
into code, and a mechanical process (applied either by a programmer or
by a program) applies the rules.

<p>That isn't to say that you can be slapdash about your models. Often
people will treat the modelling phase as if it were a sketchy
whiteboard activity; you can't do that if the model is going to be
translated directly into code (not that that was ever a good idea!)

<p>Examples of commercial products which take this approach are
Software through Pictures from <a
href="http://www.aonix.com/">Aonix</a> and <a
href="http://www.artisansw.com/">ARTiSAN Software</a>'s Real-Time
Modeler.

<p>It's important that the tool lets the architect adopt different
strategies depending on circumstances. For example, ColdFrame
generates quite different code for a class with the stereotype
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>This need makes it very advantageous to have a complete programming
environment available while scripting the output. Predetermined
substitution variables aren't likely to fill the bill.

<h2><a name="preparation">Preparation of models in Rational
Rose</a></h2>

<h3>Shlaer-Mellor aspects</h3>

<p>It's not possible here to give a detailed tutorial on the
Shlaer-Mellor approach. An excellent book is "How to Build
Shlaer-Mellor Object Models", Leon Starr, Prentice-Hall 1996, ISBN
0-13-207663-2. Note also that the full Shlaer-Mellor approach involves
full translation of the code of operations and actions as well as the
generation of the framework which is all that ColdFrame attempts (this
year).

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk might be identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark and
Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start Date then
become "identifying attributes", whereas Date Of Issue and Period Of
Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>In ColdFrame, you must <em>not</em> specify identifiers for

<ul>
<li>child classes in inheritance relationships,
<li>associative classes,
<li>singletons, or
<li>types.
</ul>

All other classes must have identifiers.

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the object
of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name, the
subject is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might have
<em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>. Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing. <em>[By the way, the references are far from clear whether
this choice of end convention is in fact correct. I think it is,
judging by the way Rose and Rhapsody show associations in the Browser
and generate code.]</em>

<p>Careful consideration of the multiplicity of associations is very
important. Clearly each <em>Screen</em> <em>"displays"</em> a number
of <em>Window</em>s, but can a <em>Window</em> <em>"appear on"</em>
more than one <em>Screen</em>? (perhaps, if you have multi-headed
display capability). Can you have a <em>Window</em> which <em>"appears
on"</em> no <em>Screen</em>s? (well, no, not if your display
technology is X--in which case <em>"appears on"</em> may not be quite
right either, since the application could be iconised).

<p>Unconditional multiplicity is good; if each end of an association
is conditional (0..1, 0..n), maybe you should think more carefully
about it. Perhaps there's some super/subtype (inheritance)
relationship lurking in there.

<p>Resist the temptation to put containers in the model. In <em>Window
"appears on" Screen</em>, the association itself models the user
concept of "each screen displays a list of windows" (actually,
thinking about it, I'm not at all sure that the actual user ever had
the concept "list" in mind at all. She's much more likely to have said
"each screen displays a <em>number</em> of windows". I think this
"list" was implanted there by some ex-programmer with a solution in
mind, rather than by someone listening to the customer!)

<p>Associations need to be "formalised" by the use of "referential
attributes". Considering the <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>,
where clearly there are many <em>Window</em>s but only one
<em>Screen</em>, you'd need a referential attribute
<em>screen&nbsp;id</em> in the <em>Window</em> instance.

<p>All parent classes in inheritance relationships are, in a sense,
abstract: whenever an instance of the parent class exists, there
exists precisely one related instance of one of the child
classes. Inheritance relationships are also formalised; typically the
child class has the same identifying attributes as the parent, but in
ColdFrame the formalization is a reference to the parent.

<p>ColdFrame supports polymorphism. Instance operations marked
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em> are dispatched to the current child
(skipping down the inheritance tree until a concrete implementation is
found), while a child class receives upward-dispatching
implementations of all concrete parental instance operations.

<p>In spite of the above, with ColdFrame you usually don't need to
provide referential attributes (it would be quite cumbersome to do so,
since Rose is unaware of the concept). Instead, ColdFrame
automatically inserts them using an appropriate naming
convention. Sometimes it needs a little help, for example for <a
href="#formalizes">complex formalization</a> or <a href="#source">in a
symmetric association</a>.

<h3>Use of Stereotypes</h3>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<p>Identifying attributes are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;id&#187;</em>.

<h4>Classes</h4>

<p>Classes which represent user-defined types are marked with the
stereotype <em>&#171;type&#187;</em>.

<p>Classes of which there is only ever one instance are marked with
the stereotype <em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<p>Public classes, which are the only classes visible from outside the
Domain, are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;public&#187;</em>. This implies the stereotype
<em>&#171;singleton&#187;</em>.

<h4>Operations</h4>

<p>Dispatching operations are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;abstract&#187;</em>.

<p>Class operations are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;class&#187;</em>.

<p>Operations to be called from the Domain <tt>Initialize</tt>
procedure are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;init&#187;</em>. This implies the stereotype
<em>&#171;class&#187;</em>. These operations must be parameterless
procedures.

<p>Operations to be called to clean up as an instance is deleted (for
example, to tidy up associations) are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;finalize&#187;</em>. (It would be possible in theory to use
Ada's controlled types, but (a) that depends on your target language
being Ada, and (b) GNAT (3.14) has a problem in the interaction of the
<tt>with type</tt> facility and controlled types).

<p>Operations which are automatically generated by ColdFrame but which
are required to be present so that they can be used on sequence
diagrams (eg, <tt>Find</tt>, <tt>Delete</tt>, <tt>All_Instances</tt>)
are marked with the stereotype <em>&#171;generated&#187;</em>. This
effectively means "ignore this".

<h3><a name="annotation">Other annotations</a></h3>

<p>It's not at all convenient to put all the extra information you
need for code generation into stereotypes. Instead, "annotations" can
be put into the documentation section (in Rose the bottom left pane),
in sections delimited by <tt>[[&nbsp;]]</tt>; for example,
<tt>[[&nbsp;mode&nbsp;:&nbsp;in&nbsp;out&nbsp;]]</tt>.

<p>Annotations supported are:

<dl>

<dt>on domains<dd><ul>

<li><tt>revision : <i>revision-id-string</i></tt> specifies the
domain's version control ID.

<p>In Rose with CVS, you'd select the domain Package in the browser
and add the line

<!-- couldn't actually use the $ here! -->
<pre>
  [[ revision : &#36;Id&#36; ]]
</pre>

to the documentation pane. Modify as required by your version control
system.

</ul>

<p>

<dt>on classes<dd><ul>

<li><tt>abbreviation : <i>abbrev</i></tt> specifies the class'
abbreviation. By default, the abbreviation is composed of the initial
letters of the full class name; this wouldn't work for, for example,
<i>Pet</i> and <i>Person</i>.

<li><tt>max : <i>max-size</i></tt> specifies the maximum number of
instances that will coexist. This may provoke a different code
generation strategy.

</ul>

<p>

<dt>on <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> classes<dd><ul>

<li><tt>callback : <i>max</i></tt> specifies that <a
href="coldframe-callback.pdf">callback support code</a> is to be
generated. The idea here is that a (lower-level) Domain may need to
support up to <tt><i>max</i></tt> Observers from higher-level Domains,
and the higher-level Domains can register to be notified when
something has changed in the lower-level Domain.

<li><tt>discriminated</tt> (only relevant if the type is a record
type, ie has attributes) causes the generation of discriminated
records; the discriminant is an enumeration type with literals formed
from the attribute names with <tt>_T</tt> appended.

<li><tt>enumeration : <i>literal-1</i>, <i>literal-2</i>, ...</tt>

<li><tt>imported : <i>external-reference</i></tt> specifies that the
given type is to be found at the specified external reference. For
Ada, this results (for a type named <tt>T</tt>) in
<pre>
  with <i>external-reference</i>;
  ..
  subtype T is <i>external-reference</i>.T;
</pre>
(clearly <tt><i>external-reference</i></tt> needs to correspond to a
with-able package name).

<li><tt>integer : lower <i>low-bound</i>, upper
<i>upper-bound</i></tt>

<li><tt>real : digits <i>num-digits</i>, lower <i>low-bound</i>,
upper <i>upper-bound</i></tt>

<li><tt>set : <i>class-name</i></tt> (for parameters or return values
of operations involving more than one instance at once, eg "find all
the outstanding Problem Reports on this Component").

<li><tt>string : max <i>max-length</i></tt>

</ul>

<p>

<dt>on attributes<dd><ul>

<li><tt>id</tt> indicates that the attribute is an identifying
attribute. This is an alternative to the <em>&#171;id&#187;</em>
stereotype.

<li><a name="formalizes"><tt>formalizes :
<i>association-name</i></tt></a> indicates that the attribute is a
referential attribute.

<p>This is needed when the attribute has to be specified by the
analyst (normally, ColdFrame can create referential attributes as
required).

<p>Consider R8, Licence is-issued-by Licensing Office. The identifier
of Licence consists of the licence number and also the issuing
Licensing Office, since the various offices don't use disjoint licence
number ranges. In this case, we'd specify the attribute as
<pre>
  &#171;id&#187; issuing office : Licensing Office
</pre>

and include the annotation
<pre>
  [[ formalizes : r8 ]]
</pre>

</ul>

<dt>on operations<dd><ul>

<li><tt>abstract</tt> indicates that the operation will be implemented
in a child class.

<li><tt>access</tt> indicates that the operation is in fact an access
type (pointer-to-subprogram with the indicated profile).

<li><tt>class</tt> indicates that the operation is a class operation
(no <tt>This</tt> parameter will be generated). This is an
alternative to the <em>&#171;class&#187;</em> stereotype.

</ul>

<p>

<dt>on parameters<dd><ul>

<li><tt>mode : <i>mode-string</i></tt>, where <tt><i>mode-string</i></tt> is
<ul>
<li><tt>in</tt>
<li><tt>inout</tt> or <tt>in out</tt>
<li><tt>out</tt>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>

<dt>on roles<dd><ul>

<li><a name="source"><tt>source</tt></a> indicates that the class at
this end is the source of formalising (referential) attributes for the
association: only useful for symmetrical associations <i>1:1</i>,
<i>1c:1c</i>, <i>1-(1:1)</i> or <i>1-(1c:1c)</i>, for which it is
required.

</ul>

</dl>

<p>You can only have one annotation section per documentation section,
but multiple semicolon-separated annotations are allowed
(syntactically; ColdFrame may not check whether they make sense
semantically).

<h2><a name="extraction">Extraction of models from Rose</a></h2>

<p>The Rose model is extracted to a raw "domain definition file" (type
<tt>.raw</tt>) using a RoseScript script <tt>extractor.ebs</tt>.

<p>Install <tt>extractor.ebs</tt> in the Rose <i>Add-ins</i> menu (or
whichever other one you want to use). In
<tt>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rose\</tt> or thereabouts, edit
<tt>rose.mnu</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Menu Add-Ins
{
  Separator

  option "Generate &XML..."	
   {
	RoseScript $ColdFrame\extractor.ebs
   }

}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This means, of course, that you must set the Rose Path Map variable
<tt>ColdFrame</tt> to the directory where ColdFrame is installed (eg,
<tt>d:\cf-20010707</tt>).

<p>The Extractor extracts data for the selected Domain packages or, if
none are selected, for all the packages on the current active class
diagram (if any). A recommended approach is to have a diagram (called
<i>Code Generation</i>, perhaps) and drag all the Domain packages in
your model onto it.

<p>You can select packages to be extracted either in the broswer
(<em>not</em> with Rose 98i) or in the Code Generation diagram.

<p>The extracted domain definition file name is the domain name with
underscores substituted for spaces.

<p>You can specify the output file location using the Rose Path Map
variable <tt>ColdFrameOut</tt>. The default output file location if
<tt>ColdFrameOut</tt> isn't specified is the directory that
<tt>extractor.ebs</tt> was loaded from (sorry about
that). Double-clicking on the <tt>.mdl</tt> file or using the "recent
documents" facility of Windows opens Rose with the correct default
directory.

<p>The output format is XML, using a Document Type Description (<a
href="ddf.dtd">DTD</a>) designed to be easy to output from RoseScript
and to handle in the next stage using a SAX-compliant parser.

<h2><a name="conversion">Conversion to standard form</a></h2>

<p>ColdFrame's "standard form" uses a home-grown <a
href="coldframe.dtd">DTD</a> rather than the standard XMI Metadata
Interchange (XMI) one. This is, I'm afraid, because I didn't think to
check what standardisation activities were under way; however, I think
it would have taken a lot longer if I'd used XMI. Perhaps an
appropriate approach would be to use an XSL transform to convert
documents from XMI to ColdFrame.

<p>The processing is done using the <em><a
href="resources.html#tcl">itcl</a></em> script
<tt>normalize-rose.tcl</tt>, which uses the <a
href="resources.html#xml">TclXML</a> package to handle the parse of
the <tt><i>package-name</i>.raw</tt> file. The Makefile places the
output in <tt><i>package-name</i>.norm</tt>.

<h2><a name="generation">Generation of code</a></h2>

<p>Code is generated using the <a href="resources.html#xslt">XSLT</a>
stylesheet <tt>generate-ada.xsl</tt>. The XSLT processor I've used is
<em>Saxon</em>.

<p>The output is placed by the <tt>Makefile</tt> into one Ada source
file, <tt><i>package-name</i>.ada</tt>.

<p>If you're using <a href="http://www.gnat.com/">GNAT</a>, you'll
then need to use <tt>gnatchop</tt> to split the file into the required
"one file per library unit" style. Other compilers will have their own
way of importing the code.

<p>The generated code is compilable, but all the operation bodies will
raise the exception <tt>Program_Error</tt> if called. ColdFrame makes
no attempt to allow you to modify generated bodies and preserve your
changes on the next generation; instead, the idea is that you keep the
generated code in one directory and your real code bodies in another
directory that's earlier on the compiler's source search path. <i>[I'm
not sure how the idea of placing real subprogram body files earlier in
the compiler's source search path translates to compilers other than
GNAT.]</i>

<h2><a name="support">Specially written support components</a></h2>

<p>Specially written support components appear under the top-level
package <tt>ColdFrame</tt>.

<dl>

<dt><tt>ColdFrame.Access_Hash</tt>

<dd>A hash function for access values (useful for associative classes).

<dt><tt>ColdFrame.Callbacks</tt>

<dd>Provides callback (Observer) support.

<dt><tt>ColdFrame.Exceptions</tt>

<dd>Provides exceptions. These are at present just renamings of <a
href="use-of-bcs.html">Booch</a> exceptions.

<dt><tt>ColdFrame.Global_Storage_Pool</tt>

<dd>Provides a (GNAT-specific) Storage Pool type and instance, using
the standard system <tt>malloc</tt> pool, suitable for instantiating
<a href="use-of-bcs.html">Booch Containers</a>.

<br>You may find <tt>GNAT.Debug_Pools</tt> useful!

<dt><tt>ColdFrame.String_Hash</tt>

<dd>Provides a set of hash functions, suitable for use as hashes (or
part of hashes) for instantiating <a href="use-of-bcs.html">Booch Map
containers</a>.
