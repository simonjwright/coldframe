<h1>ColdFrame: Architecture</h1>

The first version of ColdFrame contains a single software
architecture. This involves:

<ul>

<li><a href="#strategy">a strategy</a>,

<li><a href="#preparation">preparation of models in Rational Rose</a>,

<li><a href="#extraction">extraction of models from Rose</a>,

<li><a href="#conversion">conversion to standard form</a>,

<li><a href="#generation">generation of code</a>,

<li>using <a href="#support">specially written support components</a>

<li>and a set of <a href="#containers">generic container components</a>.

</ul>

<h2><a name="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>It's fundamental to the idea of ColdFrame that you don't need to
build a design model by decorating your clean, beautiful analysis
model with all sorts of support clutter (lists, queues etc). The
software architect decides how analysis models are to be translated
into code, and a mechanical process (applied either by a programmer or
by a program) applies the rules.

<p>Examples of commercial products which take this approach are
Software through Pictures from <a
href="http://www.aonix.com/">Aonix</a> and ARTiSAN from ARTiSAN
Software.

<p>It's important that the tool lets the architect adopt different
strategies depending on circumstances. For example, the first release
of ColdFrame assumes that a class with no attributes is a singleton
(rather like a Controller) and generates quite different
code. <i>[Possibly it should only do this if there are no
<em>identifying</em> attributes?]</i>

<p>This need makes it very advantageous to have a complete programming
environment available while scripting the output. Predetermined
substitution variables aren't likely to fill the bill.

Rose</a></h2>

<h3>Shlaer-Mellor aspects</h3>

<p>It's not possible here to give a detailed tutorial on the
Shaler-Mellor approach. An excellent book is "How to Build
Shaler-Mellor Object Models", Leon Starr, Prentice-Hall 1996, ISBN
0-13-207663-2.

<p>Instances of a Class must be uniquely identifiable by some
attribute or combination of attributes. For example, a Vehicle Excise
Disk might be identified by the combination of Vehicle Index Mark and
Validity Start Date. Vehicle Index Mark and Validity Start Date then
become "identifying attributes", whereas Date Of Issue and Period Of
Validity are just common-or-garden attributes.

<p>Role names in associations are very important, and should be verbs
or verb phrases. Each end of the association must be named; the
subject of the verb phrase is the class at the same end as the name,
the object is the class at the other end. So, for example, you might
have <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>, <em>Screen "displays"
Window</em>. Often the role names will be inverses of each other, but
sometimes things really do seem different depending on where you're
standing. <i>[By the way, the references are far from clear whether
this choice of end convention is in fact correct.]</i>

<p>Careful consideration of multiplicity is very important.
Unconditional multiplicity is good; if each end of an association is
conditional (0..1, 0..n), maybe you should think more carefully about
it. Perhaps there's some super/subtype (inheritance) relationship
lurking in there.

<p>Associations need to be "formalised" by the use of "referential
attributes". Considering the <em>Window "appears on" Screen</em>,
where clearly there are many <em>Window</em>s but only one
<em>Screen</em>, you'd need a referential attribute
<em>screen&nbsp;id</em> in the <em>Window</em> instance.

<p>All parent classes in inheritance relationships are, in a sense,
abstract: whenever an instance of the parent class exists, there
exists precisely one related instance of one of the child
classes. Inheritance relationships are also formalised; typically (in
ColdFrame, always) the child class has the same identifying attributes
as the parent.

<p>In spite of the above, with ColdFrame you don't need to provide
referential attributes (it would be quite cumbersome to do so, since
Rose is unaware of the concept). Instead, ColdFrame automatically
inserts them using an appropriate naming convention.

<h3>Use of Stereotypes</h3>

<p>Identifying attributes are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;id&#187;</em>.

<p>Class operations are marked with the stereotype
<em>&#171;class&#187</em>.

<p>Classes which represent user-defined types are marked with the
stereotype <em>&#171;type&#187</em>.

<h3>Other annotations</h3>

<p>It's not at all convenient to put all the extra information you
need for code generation into stereotypes. Instead, "annotations" can
be put into the documentation section (in Rose the bottom left pane),
in sections delimited by <tt>[[&nbsp;]]</tt>; for example,
<tt>[[&nbsp;mode&nbsp;:&nbsp;in&nbsp;out&nbsp;]]</tt>.

<p>Annotations supported are:

<dl>

<dt>on <em>&#171;type&#187;</em> classes<dd><ul>

<li><tt>enumeration : <i>literal 1</i>, <i>literal 2</i>, ...</tt>

<li><tt>real : digits <i>num-digits</i>, lower <i>low-bound</i>,
upper <i>upper-bound</i></tt>

<li><tt>string : <i>max-length</i></tt>

</ul>

<dt>on parameters<dd><ul>

<li><tt>mode : <i>mode-string</i></tt>, where <tt><i>mode-string</i></tt> is
<ul>
<li><tt>in</tt>
<li><tt>inout</tt> or <tt>in out</tt>
<li><tt>out</tt>
</ul>

</ul>

</dl>

<p>You can only have one annotation section per documentation section,
but multiple annotations are allowed (semicolon-separated).

<h2><a name="extraction">Extraction of models from Rose</a></h2>

<p>The Rose model is extracted to a raw "domain definition file" using
a RoseScript script <tt>ddf.ebs</tt>. Eventually I'll work out how to
run this script in a more friendly manner, but for the moment:

<ul>

<li>load the script into Rose, using <i>Tools/Open Script</i>

<li>select the top-level logical package to be extracted in the model
browser

<li><i>run</i> the script.

</ul>

<p>The output is in a file named <tt><i>package-name</i>.raw</tt> (so
it would be as well if <tt><i>package-name</i></tt> is a legal base
file name! spaces may be a bad idea).
