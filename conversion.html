<h1>ColdFrame: Conversion to standard form</h1>

<p>ColdFrame's "standard form" uses a home-grown <a
href="coldframe.dtd">DTD</a> rather than the standard XMI Metadata
Interchange (XMI) one. This is, I'm afraid, because I didn't think to
check what standardisation activities were under way; however, I think
it would have taken a lot longer if I'd used XMI. Perhaps an
appropriate approach would be to use an XSL transform to convert
documents from XMI to ColdFrame.

<p>The processing is done using the <em><a
href="resources.html#tcl">itcl</a></em> script
<tt>normalize-rose.tcl</tt>, which uses the <a
href="resources.html#xml">TclXML</a> package to handle the parse of
the <tt><i>package-name</i>.raw</tt> file. The Makefile places the
output in <tt><i>package-name</i>.norm</tt>.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p><tt>normalize-rose.tcl</tt> takes the options

<dl>

<dt><tt>--casing <i>filename</i></tt>

<dd>Specifies the name of a case-exceptions file.

<p>The file format is basically that used by ACT's GLIDE (Emacs
<tt>ada-mode</tt>), except that ColdFrame doesn't distinguish
substring specs from whole-identifier ones.

<p>Each line contains a single specification of a desired
casing. <tt>ColdFrame</tt> means that all occurrences of the string
<tt>coldframe</tt>, in any case, as the whole of an identifier or as a
space- or underscore-delimited part of an identifier, will be
capitalized as given.

<p>GLIDE's rules require you to indicate which are "substring
exceptions", so if you want <tt>io</tt> to be capitalized as
<tt>IO</tt> even if it occurs in <tt>text_io</tt>, resulting in
<tt>Text_IO</tt>, you have to write <tt>*IO</tt> in the exceptions
file.

<p><tt>--casing</tt> can be repeated as often as required for
multiple case exception files. If an exception occurs multiple times,
the last one counts.

<p>Default is to do "title case" casing always (so <tt>text io</tt>
comes out as <tt>Text_Io</tt>).

<p>

<dt><tt>--stack-dump</tt>

<dd>Specifies whether a Tcl stack dump is to be produced if an error
is detected in <tt>normalize-rose.tcl</tt>. This is intended for
debugging ColdFrame, not your model!

<p>Default is <i>off</i>.

<p>

<dt><tt>--verbose</tt>

<dd>Specifies whether ColdFrame should report what it's doing.

<p>Default is <i>off</i>.

<p>

<dt><tt>--version <i>version-string</i></tt>

<dd>Specifies a string (the supplied Makefiles use
<tt>cf-<i>yyyymmdd</i></tt>) which is output by this phase in the
<tt>&lt;normalizer&gt;</tt> element and is included in the comments in
the generated Ada to tell the release of <tt>normalize-rose.tcl</tt>
that was used (you might have kept an old <tt>.norm</tt> file around
after installation of a new release of ColdFrame; not necessarily a
bad thing, just nice to know).

<p>Default is not to include any string.
