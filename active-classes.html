<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A <i>task</i> is an independent thread of execution within a
program. Tasks are supported by the operating system in use, which may
well have a different name for the concept (VxWorks uses <i>task</i>,
Linux uses <i>thread</i>, Solaris uses <i>light-weight process</i>).

<p>Desktop operating systems like Windows and Linux have an additional
concept <i>process</i>. Typically, processes don't share memory but
can contain multiple threads/tasks, which do share process memory (and
other resources, such as file handles).

<p>VxWorks only has tasks.

<p>Some programming languages provide tasking (concurrency) constructs
as part of the language - for example, Ada, Java, C#. If your language
doesn't have inbuilt support, you can call operating system primitives
(for example, the VxWorks task creation operation is
<tt>taskSpawn</tt>) or rely on support libraries such as
<i>pthreads</i>.

<p>With multiple CPUs, under an operating system which can use them
(for example, an SMP-aware Linux), the program's tasks can be truly
independent, so that more than one is running at any instant. Of
course, there are still likely to be many fewer CPUs than tasks! The
normal situation is to have one CPU per computer, shared between the
tasks.

<p>This might seem to be adding complexity, and indeed it does bring
its own difficulties for programmers (especially in getting tasks to
share data safely).

<p>A key benefit is that it's much easier to deal with a multiply
concurrent problem if the separate aspects can be designed
independently. If the computer has to receive LAN updates from a radar
system at the same time as initializing a different comms device using
a complex multi-step protocol, it's as well if the two concerns can be
kept separate (including, if possible, implementation by different
teams, which ColdFrame supports by <a href="domains.html">domains</a>).


<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Aside from the tasks which are semi-incidentally involved with <a
href="events.html">event handling</a>, tasks are needed for two
purposes:

<ul>

<li>to manage blocking input-output, and

<li>to manage hard real time responses.

</ul>

<h3>Blocking input-output</h3>

<p>If your application has to wait for something to arrive from the
outside (for example, for an Ethernet message from another part of the
system), the natural way to program it is to use a blocking read.

<p>One example would be calling <tt>GNAT.Sockets.Accept_Socket</tt>,
which blocks until a client (probably in another processor) chooses to
call <tt>Connect_Socket</tt>.

<p>Another example, from the <a
href="serialization.html">serialization</a> demonstration, is
<pre>
   declare
      Rec : constant ColdFrame.Project.Serialization.Base'Class :=
        ColdFrame.Project.Serialization.Base'Class'Input (Channel);
   begin
      ...
</pre>

<p>where the <tt>'Class'Input</tt> call blocks.

<p>It would be <em>quite incorrect</em> to make these calls within
ColdFrame's normal event processing, because the event queue concerned
would be effectively stopped until the blocking call completed. They
need to be made from distinct tasks.

<h3>Hard real time responses</h3>

<p>Two (related) approaches to managing multiple concurrent jobs which
have to meet deadlines are <a
href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/descriptions/rma_body.html">Rate
Monotonic Analysis</a> (RMA) and <a
href="http://www.embedded.com/2000/0006/0006feat1.htm">Deadline
Monotonic Analysis</a> (DMA).

<p>Both are concerned mainly with <i>periodic</i> or cyclic jobs; for
example, driving a tracker radar to point at its target at 64 Hz,
where you mustn't miss the correct time to output the demands because
you'll lose the target (or perhaps rattle the tracker to pieces!)

<p>Both rely on preemptive scheduling (high-priority tasks forcibly
suspend, or preempt, lower-priority tasks). Each job is allocated to a
task (usually one job per task, but two jobs with the same scheduling
requirements could be allocated to one task, other things being
equal).

<p>RMA allocates the highest priority to the task which has to run
most frequently, while DMA allocates it to the task with the shortest
deadline (ie, the shortest period between when it can start a cycle of
processing and when it has to have completed).


<h2>Modelling</h2>

<p>You specify a class as active by marking it with the stereotype
«active» or, if preferred, by setting the Concurrency attribute in the
Detail tab of the Rose specification dialog box to <i>Active</i> (which is
less immediately visible).

<p>Procedure operations (ie, those without a return value) of an
active class can be stereotyped «entry»; see <a
href="http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-9-5.html">ARM
9.5</a> for a discussion on entries.

<p>It is permitted for an «entry» operation to have the same name as
an ordinary operation.

<p>You can specify the run-time priority of the task using the tag
<i>priority</i>. The form is
<pre>
   {priority = <i>priority relative to system default</i>}
</pre>

<p>You can specify the stack size of the task using the tag
<i>stack</i>. The form is
<pre>
   {stack = <i>stack size</i>}
</pre>


<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>Each instance of an «active» class has an associated task. The
task's name, if supported by the operating system, is
<tt><i>Domain.Class</i></tt>.

<p>You access the task using <tt>This.The_T</tt>; so if there is an
<i>«entry» Start</i>, you would call it as <tt>This.The_T.Start</tt>.


<h2>Use</h2>

<h3>Accessing instance attributes and calling operations</h3>

<p>The task is constrained by <tt>This : access Instance</tt>, so
within the task you can quite often treat <tt>This</tt> as if it were
a <tt>Handle</tt>. However, it isn't quite, so if the compiler
complains use a view conversion:
<pre>
   Handle (This)
</pre>

<h3>Deleting the instance</h3>

<p>The generated <tt>Delete</tt> operation of an «active» class aborts
the task before freeing the task and instance memory. This means that
if you call <tt>Delete</tt> from the task you are pulling the rug from
under your feet!

<p>What's needed is <i>another</i> task. The nearest candidate is the
task in the <a href="event-use.html">event queue</a> for the domain; so
the canonical solution is to post an event to the event queue which
will <tt>Delete</tt> the instance when it fires.

<p>Some examples of this idiom have posted the event to run after a
delay. This should not be necessary.

<p>To avoid the need for a special state machine, a <i>«class
event»</i> should be used.
