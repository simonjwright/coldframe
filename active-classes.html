<h1>ColdFrame: Active Classes</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A <i>task</i> is an independent thread of execution within a
program. Tasks are supported by the operating system in use, which may
well have a different name for the concept (VxWorks uses <i>task</i>,
Linux uses <i>thread</i>, Solaris uses <i>light-weight process</i>).

<p>Desktop operating systems like Windows and Linux have an additional
concept <i>process</i>. Typically, processes don't share memory but
can contain multiple threads/tasks, which do share process memory (and
other resources, such as file handles).

<p>VxWorks only has tasks.

<p>Some programming languages provide tasking (concurrency) constructs
as part of the language - for example, Ada, Java, C#. If your language
doesn't have inbuilt support, you can call operating system primitives
(for example, the VxWorks task creation operation is
<tt>taskSpawn</tt>) or rely on support libraries such as
<i>pthreads</i>.

<p>With multiple CPUs, under an operating system which can use them
(for example, an SMP-aware Linux) the program's tasks can be truly
independent, so that more than one is running at any instant. Of
course, there are still likely to be many fewer CPUs than tasks! The
normal situation is for the CPU to be shared between the tasks.

<p>This might seem to be adding complexity, and indeed it does bring
its own difficulties for programmers (especially in getting tasks to
share data safely).

<p>A key benefit is that it's much easier to deal with a multiply
concurrent problem if the separate aspects can be designed
independently. If the computer has to receive LAN updates from a radar
system at the same time as initializing a different comms device using
a complex multi-step protocol, it's as well if the two concerns can be
kept separate (including, if possible, implementation by different
teams).
