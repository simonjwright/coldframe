<h1>ColdFrame: Documentation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>ColdFrame can generate HTML-formatted documentation from your
model.

<p>At first sight this may seem unnecessary. However, there are at
least three reasons why it may be helpful:

<ul>

<li>It shows what is actually present in the model. It's very easy to
omit things from a diagram in the CASE tool, giving a misleading
impression: for example, a forgotten transition on a state diagram.

<li>It is in a more amenable format for comparison than typical model
files. You can generate documentation for the model as it was and as
it is now, and use Microsoft Word (or possibly Libre Office) to
compare the two documents for review.

<li>It is hyperlinked.

</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>No special installation is needed, but diagram generation depends
on <a href="https://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a>.

<p>Normally you should have Graphviz's binary directory on your PATH:
if not, set the environment variables <tt>DOT</tt> and <tt>CIRCO</tt>
to the locations of <tt>dot</tt> and <tt>circo</tt> respectively.

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Assuming you have set up your Makefile using the
supplied <tt>Makefile.inc</tt>, simply say
<pre>
make <i>Domain</i>.html
</pre>
<p>or, if you don't want diagrams (easier to do comparisons, perhaps;
or maybe you can't install Graphviz),
<pre>
make <i>Domain</i>.html GENERATE_DIAGRAMS=no
</pre>

<p>Images will be created in the
subdirectory <tt><i>Domain</i>.images/</tt>, which needs to be copied
with <tt><i>Domain</i>.html</tt>.
